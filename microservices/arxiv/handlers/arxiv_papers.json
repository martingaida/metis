    "abstract": "Bremsstrahlung emission of photons during nuclear reactions inside dense stellar medium is investigated in the paper. For that, a new model of nucleus is developed, where nuclear forces combine nucleons as bound system in dependence on deep location inside compact star. A polytropic model of stars at index $n=3$ with densities characterized from white dwarf to neutron star is used. Bremsstrahlung formalism and calculations are well tested on existed experimental information for scattering of protons of light nuclei in Earth. We find the following. (1) In neutron stars a phenomenon of dissociation of nucleus is observed --- its disintegration on individual nucleons, starting from some critical distance between this nucleus and center of star with high density. We do not observe such a phenomenon in white dwarfs. (2) In the white dwarfs, influence of stellar medium imperceptibly affects on bremsstrahlung photons. Also, we have accurate description of bremsstrahlung photons in nuclear reactions in Sun. (3) For neutron stars, influence of stellar medium is essentially more intensive and it crucially changes the bremsstrahlung spectrum. The most intensive emission is from bowel of the star, while the weakest emission is from periphery.",

In this work, we highlight subtleties in describing relativistic dynamical tidal responses that arise from ambiguities in the decomposition of a perturbed metric into external tidal and induced response pieces. Observables are unambiguous. However in practice, differences arising from implicit assumptions in the definition of tidal deformabilities may lead to a bias in constraining nuclear physics or gravitational theories, if not properly tied to observational data. We propose calibration of a tidal response function for any compact objects in vacuum General Relativity. Within this framework, the dynamical tidal Love numbers of a Schwarzschild black hole in both even and odd sectors vanish at any multipole order. The calibration allows one to define dynamical tidal deformabilities of relativistic stars, such as neutron stars, as the difference from the BH values (zero) under the unified definition in a simple manner. As a straightforward extension of our framework, we compute the next-to-leading dissipative tidal response of Schwarzschild black holes for the first time.",

The evidence for a GWB was reported recently by several PTAs with origins to be determined. Here we use a BBH population synthesis model to investigate the detection probability of individual BBHs by the Chinese PTA (CPTA) and the constraint on the GWB origin that may be obtained by PTA observations of both GWB and individual BBHs. If the detected GWB signal is entirely due to BBHs, a significantly positive redshift evolution ($\\propto(1+z)^{2.07}$) of the mass scaling relation between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies is required. In this case, we find that the detection probability of individual BBHs is $\\sim85\\%$ or 64% if using a period of 3.4-year CPTA observation data, with an expectation of $\\sim1.9$ or 1.0 BBHs detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio $\\geq3$ or $5$, and it is expected to increase to $>95\\%$ if extending the observation period to $5$ years or longer. Even if the contribution from BBHs to the GWB power signal is as small as $\\sim10\\%$, a positive detection of individual BBHs can still be expected within an observation period of $\\sim10$ years. A non-detection of individual BBHs within several years from now jointly with the detected GWB signal can put a strong constraint on the upper limit of the BBH contribution to the GWB signal and help identify/falsify a cosmological origin.",

The equatorial motion of spinning test particles and the properties of the innermost stable circular orbit are further studied. We find that the existence of dark matter halos can significantly change the orbital eccentricity, energy, and the innermost stable circular orbit parameters of spinning test particles.

Furthermore they revealed the effects of the electric charge of the black hole on the surrounding plasma. Since their results mainly rely on non-relativistic analyses, we study the same subject through relativistic analyses in this paper. By investigating a test particle in the Schwarzschild spacetime, we find that if initial velocities of protons and electrons far from a black hole follow the Maxwell distribution, the black hole can acquire electric charge whose value depends on the ratio of temperature of the proton and that of the electron. We also show that if the black hole acquires the electric charge, the radii of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the specific energy of a charged particle on ISCO can be very different from those of a neutral particle. In contrast to the result obtained by Zajacek et al, we find that the ISCO radii of a proton and an electron are necessarily larger than that of a neutral test particle as long as the black hole acquires the charge. The large ISCO radius might lead to a larger angular diameter of a black hole shadow and a different estimate of the released energy due to the accretion of plasma from the estimate based on the assumption of electric neutrality of the central black hole.",

    "abstract": "Renormalization of physical quantities for quantum field theories in curved spacetimes can be achieved via the consistent subtraction of counterterms within a regularization scheme such as a point-splitting method. Pragmatic mode-sum regularization (PMR) is a point-splitting method which is particularly suitable for rotating black hole spacetimes. We extend and tailor the t-splitting variant of PMR specifically for the interior of a Kerr black hole on the axis of rotation, focusing on a minimally-coupled massless scalar field in the physically-motivated Unruh state. The method addresses unique challenges in the black hole interior that do not occur outside. In particular, while the infinite sum over multipolar number l converges in the black hole exterior, it diverges in the interior, necessitating the subtraction of a so-called intermediate divergence which includes introducing an additional \"small\" split in the direction of the polar angle. This procedure is outlined and justified, along with the standard PMR method's counterterms subtraction. We apply this method to calculate the renormalized energy-momentum fluxes $\\langle T_{uu}\\rangle^U_\\text{ren}$, $\\langle T_{vv}\\rangle^U_\\text{ren}$ (where u and v are the standard Eddington coordinates) and the renormalized field square $\\langle \\Phi^2\\rangle^U_\\text{ren}$ throughout the black hole interior, spanning from (just off) the event horizon to (just off) the inner horizon. Special emphasis is placed on the inner horizon vicinity, where our t-splitting results for the fluxes asymptote to those obtained directly at the inner horizon using a different method in a previous work. In an Appendix, we develop an alternative t-splitting PMR variant which does not include the intermediate divergence subtraction. We utilize it for independent computations that are used to verify the standard t-splitting variant presented in the main text.",

Since this alternate formulation can be directly applied to the real-time quantum theory, it is insensitive to subtleties involved in defining the Euclidean path integral. In particular, it can be consistent with many different choices of integration contour.   Despite the fact that self-adjoint operators in the associated real-time quantum theory have real eigenvalues, we note that the bulk wavefunction encodes the Euclidean (or complex) R\\'enyi geometries that would arise in any Euclidean path integral. As a result, for any given quantum state, the appropriate real-time path integral yields both R\\'enyi entropies and associated complex saddle-point geometries that agree with Euclidean methods.

    "title": "Astrophysical systematics on testing general relativity with gravitational waves from galactic double white dwarfs",
    "abstract": "Gravitational waves have been shown to provide new constraints on gravitational theories beyond general relativity (GR), especially in the strong field regime. Gravitational wave signals from galactic double white dwarfs, expected to be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), also have the potential to place stringent bounds on certain theories that give rise to relatively large deviations from GR in less compact binaries, such as through scalar radiation. Nevertheless, the orbital evolution of close double white dwarf systems is also affected by various astrophysical effects, such as stellar rotation, tidal interactions, and magnetic interactions, which add complexity to the gravity tests. In this work, we employ the parametrized post-Einsteinian model to capture the leading beyond-GR effect on the signal and estimate the measurement uncertainties using the Fisher information matrix. We then study the systematic error caused by ignoring each astrophysical effect mentioned above on the parameter estimation. Our numerical results show that, to place bounds on the non-GR effects comparable to existing bounds from pulsar observations, tight priors on the mass of the binary and long observation time are required. At this level of sensitivity, we found that systematic errors from the astrophysical effects dominate statistical errors. The most significant effects investigated here are torques from tidal synchronization and magnetic unipolar induction for sufficiently large magnetic fields ($>10^7$G). Meanwhile, even the weaker astrophysical effects from quadrupolar deformations are of a similar order of magnitude as the statistical uncertainty, and hence cannot be ignored in the waveform model. We conclude that the astrophysical effects must be carefully accounted for in the parameter estimation to test gravity with galactic double white dwarfs detected by LISA.",

    "abstract": "Almost all spiral galaxies have been observed to have flattening rotation curves. The new Gaia DR3 released data shows a Milky Way sharply Keplerian declining rotation curve, starting at $\\sim 16$ kpc and ending at 26.5 kpc. The data reduces the total Milky Way mass by an order of magnitude, $M=2.06\\times 10^{11}M_{\\odot}$, compared to the standard required dark matter halo mass, $(2-5)\\times10^{12}M_\\odot$. Newtonian and modified gravity (MOG) fits are applied to the Gaia DR3 rotation curve data. The fit obtained using MOG has a total mass of $M\\sim1.3\\times 10^{11}M_{\\odot}$, while the Newtonian fit predicts a mass of $M\\sim2\\times 10^{11}M_{\\odot}$. These are in excess of the estimated visible baryon mass of the Milky Way, $M_b\\sim (0.6-1.0)\\times 10^{11}M_{\\odot}$. It is possible that if the cicumgalactic (CGM) plasma-gas continues to be confirmed experimentally, then the additional baryon mass required to account for the estimated total Milky Way mass could be attributed to the CGM hot plasma-gas halo.",

For the latter aspect, we also extend the analysis to massive particle modes, resulting in a ``combination'' of modified Yukawa- and Couloumb-like potentials. These calculations are shown to be dependent on the wormhole's parameters, particularly the wormhole throat.

Minimal triway cuts can be formulated as integer programs which cannot be relaxed to find a dual maximal flow/bit-thread description. This sheds light on the gap between the existence of tripartite entanglement in holographic states and the bipartite entanglement structure motivated by bit-threads. In particular, we prove that the Markov gap that measures tripartite entanglement is lower bounded by the integrality gap of the integer program that computes the triway cut.",

For a wide range of parameters, energy fluxes on the horizon are negative for all orbital radii: the modes are amplified through superradiance. More interestingly, the flux on the horizon is larger (in absolute value) than the flux at infinity for orbits with orbital radius $r_0 \\gtrsim 9M$ -- floating orbits are a generic outcome of having magnetic fields around black holes. Particles on these orbits extract energy from the BH through their radiation field; the net effect is an increase in the particles' kinetic energy, so that they outspiral to infinity.

Moreover, he conjectured that initial data on the singularity could be used to parameterize quiescent solutions to Einstein's equations; that is, roughly speaking, solutions whose leading order asymptotics are convergent. We prove that given initial data on the singularity for the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations in 4 spacetime dimensions, as defined by Ringstr\\\"om, there is a corresponding unique development of the data. We do not assume any symmetry or analyticity, and we allow for arbitrary closed spatial topology. Our results thus present an important step towards resolving Ringstr\\\"om's conjecture. Furthermore, our results show that the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations have a geometric singular initial value problem formulation, which is analogous to the classical result by Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch for initial data on a Cauchy hypersurface.   In the literature, there are two conditions which are expected to ensure that quiescent behavior occurs. The first one is an integrability condition on a special spatial frame. The second one is an algebraic condition on the eigenvalues of the expansion normalized Weingarten map associated with a foliation of the spacetime near the singularity. Our result is the first such result where both possibilities are allowed. That is, we allow for the first condition to ensure quiescence in one region of space and for the second condition to take over in the region where the first one is violated. This fact allows for our results to include the vacuum setting.",

Such instability is characterized by an exponential spiral, deviating from the quasinormal frequencies due to an insignificant perturbation moving away from the compact object. Our analysis begins with a specific case involving a truncated P\\\"oschl-Teller potential for which we derive an explicit form of the criterion. Notably, it is shown analytically, contrary to other cases studied in the literature, that the fundamental mode is stable. These derivations are then generalized to a broader context, embracing two underlying mathematical formalisms. Specifically, the spiral is attributed to either the poles in the black hole's reflection amplitude or the zeros in the transmission amplitude. Additionally, we revisit and then generalize a toy model in which perturbations to the effective potential are disjointed, demonstrating that such a configuration invariably leads to instability in the fundamental mode, and the resulting outward spiral always occurs in the counter-clockwise direction. The derived criterion is not restricted to the fundamental mode but is generally relevant for the first few low-lying modes. We demonstrate numerically that the sprial's period and the frequency's relative deviation agree well with our analytical estimations.",

It can be argued that these phenomena happen in the final stages of evaporation, where the semiclassical approximation needs to be refined with quantum corrections also for the gravitational interaction. A natural way to describe gravity at high energies is to add quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action, i.e. quadratic gravity. At the cosmological level it is known that its classical solutions can give rise to a model of inflation that matches observations strikingly well, while in an astrophysical context it allows for the possibility of non-Schwarzschild black holes at small masses. These solutions have very peculiar properties, due to the presence of a massive spin-2 particle corresponding to a ghost at the quantum level. The branch of non-Schwarzschild solutions crosses the one of Schwarzschild ones at a specific mass which could be between the one of an asteroid and the Planck mass, depending on the value of a slightly constrained free parameter. By analyzing their dynamical stability and thermodynamical properties, we investigate what could happen to a black hole that has evaporated to this crossing point.

The calculated acceleration with the emergent gravity under the assumption of a quasi-de Sitter universe agrees with the observed one within the uncertainty. Our results suggest that the emergent gravity can explain the kinematics of galaxies without introducing dark matter, even for less massive galaxies where dark matter is expected to dominate.

Since the magnetic reconnection is thought to occur frequently in the accretion flow around compact objects which induce strong gravitational field, it is now regarded to be a practical mechanism to extract energy from rotation black holes, which motivates people to consider how to describe the process of magnetic reconnection in a generally relativistic way. In this work, I try to explore the description of Sweet-Parker model, one of the most famous theoretical models of magnetic reconnection, in general relativity. I begin with revisiting the Sweet-Parker model in special relativity and reorganize the calculations in seven steps, whose generally relativistic forms are discussed. I propose in this work, from the general discussions and consequences of specific examples, that no property in Sweet-Parker model would be modified by spacetime curvature, which is opposite to the conclusions in previous work. However, on the contrary, observation in different rest frames may bring modifications. If the magnetic reconnection occurs not in the rest frame of observer, the observer would find out that the detected relation between the reconnection rate and Lundquist number or that between outflow speed and Alfven velocity are not the same as the detected relations if the magnetic reconnection occurs just in the rest frame of observer.",

As an application of this analytic formula, we demonstrate that such generic black holes satisfy Hod's proposal, which constrains the damping rate of the least damped mode in relation to the Hawking temperature.",

Assuming the validity of the holographic principle, we employ the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which describes a system of randomly infinite range interacting fermions, also conjectured to be an exactly solvable UV-complete model for an extremal black hole in a higher dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) dilaton gravity. At low energies, the SYK model exhibits an emergent conformal symmetry and is dual to the extremal black hole solution in near AdS2 spacetime. Furthermore, we show how the SYK maximally chaotic behaviour at large N limit, found to be dual to a gauge theory in higher dimensions, can also be employed as a non-trivial investigation tool for the holographic principle. The proposed setup is a theoretical platform to realize the SYK model with relevant exotic effects and behaviour at low energies as a highly non-trivial example of the AdS/CFT duality and a framework for studying black holes.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the interaction between non-extensive entropic FLRW cosmology and the power-law inflationary model, with a focus on the overlap between the scalar spectral index `$n_s$' and the tensor-to-scalar ratio `$r$'. Based on a conjecture that non-extensive entropy alters the energy-momentum content of the cosmic fluid, the analysis examines how these overlaps shift with different model parameters and compares the findings to those from Bekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropic cosmology. The study highlights the impact of Tsallis, R\\'{e}nyi, and Sharma-Mittal entropies, uncovering a significant correlation between `$n_s$' and `$r$' that suggests a deeper connection in power-law inflationary dynamics. The results demonstrate that non-extensive entropies not only enable viable inflation with a graceful exit but also address limitations inherent in the standard BH entropic framework, emphasizing the importance of precise parameter estimation. Specifically, Tsallis entropy allows for power-law inflation with $n = 1$ to $n = 2$ in alignment with Planck 2018 data. Moreover, the $\\alpha$ parameter in R\\'{e}nyi and Sharma-Mittal entropy models must be extremely small ($\\alpha \\leq 10^{-8}$ in Planck mass units) to achieve successful power-law inflation with an e-folding number around 55-65, suggesting a unified thermodynamic perspective in cosmological studies.",

Hitherto, these quantum effects were analyzed by separating the geometry into the near-horizon region and its exterior. It is desirable to understand and reproduce such corrections from the full higher-dimensional asymptotically flat or AdS geometry's perspective. We address this question in this article and fill this gap. Specifically, we find off-shell eigenmodes of the quadratic fluctuation operator of the Euclidean gravitational dynamics, with eigenvalues that vanish linearly with temperature. We illustrate this for BTZ and neutral black holes with hyperbolic horizons in AdS in Einstein-Hilbert theory, and for the charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory. The linear scaling with Matsubara frequency, which is a distinctive feature of the modes, together with the fact that their wavefunctions localize close to the horizon as we approach extremality, identifies them as responsible for the aforementioned quantum effects. We provide a contour prescription to deal with the sign indefiniteness of the Euclidean Einstein-Maxwell action, which we derive to aid our analysis. We also resolve a technical puzzle regarding modes associated with rotational isometries in stationary black hole spacetimes.",

As the onset of collapse depends on the intensity of gravity, testing for sudden derivative changes and, if they are large, breaching the Seidov limit would reward with two successive discoveries: such a phase transition (which could stem from hadron matter but also from a gravitational phase transition), and a modification of General Relativity (thus breaking the matter/gravity degeneracy).

How could we find hints of such dark sector if it is experimentally unreachable by any terrestrial experiment? In this work we study a low-mass-scale mirror Standard Model which can act as a model for dark matter, which interacts only gravitationally with the Standard Model particles. The mirror Standard Model sector particles can form mirror atoms and hadrons and all these stable particles can comprise a large part of the dark matter of the Universe. These mirror Standard Model particles acquire mass through a low-temperature dark first order phase transition. We examine in detail this dark phase transition and we indicate how stochastic gravitational waves can be generated through this transition. Such a phase transition can generate stochastic gravitational waves that can be detected by the future gravitational wave experiments. For the model we use, the produced energy spectrum of the gravitational waves can be detected by the SKA. Moreover, we propose a possible way to detect effects of the particle nature of dark matter, using observational data coming from the guitar nebula. We assume that the guitar nebula bow shock is generated by the interaction of the high speed neutron star that passes through the interstellar medium, which is assumed to be comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen. Our main proposal is that the opening angle of the bow shock can be directly related to the speed of sound of the dark matter particles, and a large angle of the bow shock could be a strong indicator that the interstellar medium is comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen gas. This is motivated by the Bosma effect which indicates that hydrogen is always in correlation with dark matter, and hydrogen gas is strongly present in the guitar nebula.",

The model is a \\emph{proxy} for the non-equilibrium dynamics of a misaligned axion condensate decaying into radiation. After consistent field quantization in the cosmological background, we obtain the causal equations of motion for a homogeneous condensate including the finite temperature self-energy corrections up to one loop. The dynamical renormalization group is implemented to obtain the time dependent relaxation rate that describes the decay dynamics of the condensate amplitude from stimulated emission and recombination of massless quanta in the medium. It is explicitly shown that a simple friction term in the equation of motion does not describe correctly the decay of the condensate. During the super-Hubble regime, relevant for ultralight dark matter, the condensate amplitude decays as $e^{-\\frac{g^2}{10} t^2\\,\\ln(1/mt)}$. In the sub-Hubble regime the amplitude decays as $e^{-\\gamma(t;T(t))/2}$ with $T(t)=T_0/a(t)$, therefore the finite temperature contribution to the decay rate vanishes fast during the expansion. A main conclusion is that a phenomenological friction term is inadequate to describe the decay in the super-Hubble regime, the decay function $\\gamma(t)$ is always \\emph{smaller} than that from a local friction term as a consequence of the cosmological expansion.

Here we apply an action-based procedure for the removal of spurious degrees of freedom for the case of general relativity supplemented by a term cubic in the Riemann tensor. To the order we work in, the resulting reduced theory takes the form of minimally modified gravity, which is a class of modified gravity theories that propagate just the massless spin-2 graviton, but exhibit a preferred frame at short distances due to a deformation of time diffeomorphisms.

    "abstract": "Recent observations about the cosmic microwave background evidence a clear discrepancy between the scale of inflation and the Planck scale expected in the conventional inflationary picture, based on simple chaotic inflationary models. This paper explores a possible resolution of this conflict by considering a slight modification of the standard general relativity scenario, which naturally incorporates a cutoff scale consistent with the observations. This last scale of power suppression appears by the combined effect of the preinflationary background dynamics and an associated initial vacuum state for the cosmological perturbations which differs from the conventional Bunch-Davies state of slow-roll inflation. We revise and correct previous discussions in the literature about the relation between this scale and the scale corresponding to the onset of inflation. The mechanism that produces this cutoff is intimately related to the criterion determining a privileged vacuum state for the primordial perturbations. We adhere to a recent proposal based on an asymptotic diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of the perturbations and leading to a non-oscillatory primordial power spectrum. With this choice, we are able to investigate analytically the model, studying in detail some physically interesting cases. These analytic calculations provide further support to our arguments about the relation between the different scales of the system.",

    "abstract": "Since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe in 1998, modified gravity (MG) theories have attracted considerable attention as alternatives to dark energy (DE). While distinguishing the effects of MG from those of DE using cosmic background expansion alone is difficult, the large-scale structure is expected to differ significantly. Among the plethora of MG models, we are particularly interested in those that introduce a scale dependence in the growth of perturbations; specifically, theories that introduce fifth forces mediated by scalar fields with a finite range accessible to cosmological probes. This is the case with $f(R)$ gravity, which is widely regarded as the most studied model in cosmology. In this work, we utilize, for the first time, the full-shape power spectrum of galaxies to constrain scale-dependent modified gravity theories. By using BOSS DR12 dataset, along with a BBN prior on $ \\omega_b $ and a Planck 2018 prior on $ n_s $, we obtain an upper bound of $ |f_{R0}| < 5.89 \\times 10^{-6} $ at 68% confidence level (c.l.) and $ < 1.53 \\times 10^{-5} $ at 95% c.l. for the Hu-Sawicki ($ n=1 $) model.

    "abstract": "In a subclass of generalized Proca theories where a cubic vector Galileon term breaks the $U(1)$ gauge invariance, it is known that there are static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions endowed with nonvanishing temporal and longitudinal vector components. Such hairy BHs are present for a vanishing vector-field mass ($m=0$) with a non-zero cubic Galileon coupling $\\beta_3$. We study the linear stability of those hairy BHs by considering even-parity perturbations in the eikonal limit. In the angular direction, we show that one of the three dynamical perturbations has a nontrivial squared propagation speed $c_{\\Omega,1}^2$, while the other two dynamical modes are luminal. We could detect two different unstable behaviors of perturbations in all the parameter spaces of hairy asymptotically flat BH solutions we searched for. In the first case, an angular Laplacian instability on the horizon is induced by negative $c_{\\Omega,1}^2$. For the second case, it is possible to avoid this horizon instability, but in such cases, the positivity of $c_{\\Omega,1}^2$ is violated at large distances. Hence these hairy BHs are generally prone to Laplacian instabilities along the angular direction in some regions outside the horizon. Moreover, we also encounter a pathological behavior of the radial propagation speeds $c_r$ possessing two different values of $c_r^2$ for one of the dynamical perturbations. Introducing the vector-field mass $m$ to cubic vector Galileons, however, we show that the resulting no-hair Schwarzschild BH solution satisfies all the linear stability conditions in the small-scale limit, with luminal propagation speeds of three dynamical even-parity perturbations.",

Gravitational waves (GWs) from these latter models would be explained by extensions to the standard model of cosmology and possibly to the standard model of particle physics.

We explore the hypothesis that ultra-high-frequency GWs could be responsible for FRB generation. Consequently, the detection of continuous GWs signal from the vicinity of an FRB by current or future detectors would disfavour merger-based FRB formation models and lend significant credence to the GZ theory, which postulates the existence of high-frequency GWs. Moreover, we examine the effects of modified gravity on the gravitational lensing of FRBs and thereby put constraints on the fraction of primordial mass black holes made up of dark matter. Our analysis suggests that modified gravity introduces a screening effect on lensing, analogous to the scattering effect by plasma on light rays.

In this work, we write down effective field theory describing relativistic dark matter production in association with neutrinos leading to a larger $H_0$. We derive limits on the effective energy scale that governs this relativistic production of dark matter as a function of the dark matter mass for fermion, vector, and scalar dark matter fields. In particular, scalar dark matter particles are more effective in increasing the effective number of relativistic species. Also, if they have weak scale masses, then the relativistic production of dark matter should be governed by Planck scale effective operators in order to alleviate the Hubble tension.",

This line of research was initiated by Bill Unruh, who established an analogy between hydrodynamic flow with a supersonic region and black holes. One possibility to exploit this hydrodynamics/gravity analogy is to create analogue black holes within Bose-Einstein condensates. At low temperatures, phonons-low energy excitations-behave like a massless scalar field in an emergent acoustic metric determined by the condensate. An acoustic black hole is created by transonic fluid, and quantum fluctuations at the acoustic horizon lead to thermal radiation of phonons, akin to Hawking radiation. This emission has been numerically simulated and experimentally verified in Bose-Einstein condensates. The goal of my Master's thesis is to design a system in which an acoustic horizon is excited by a gravitational wave-like perturbation. The thesis is divided into two main parts: the first reviews essential topics of general relativity, quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and analogue gravity; while the second presents my results. Firstly, I propose a method to reproduce a gravitational wave perturbation on a flat background acoustic metric emergent from a Bose-Einstein condensate. Secondly, I demonstrate how to implement an impinging gravitational wave-like perturbation at an acoustic horizon. I then analyze how the horizon responds to this analogue gravitational wave and discuss the implications of my work, including potential studies on shear viscosity and entropy density of the perturbed acoustic horizon.

    "abstract": "We present the successful recovery of common envelope ejection efficiency assumed in a simulated population of double white dwarf binaries like those which may be observed by the future LISA mission. We simulate the formation of double white dwarf binaries by using the COSMIC population synthesis code to sample binary formation conditions such as initial mass function, metallicity of star formation, initial orbital period, and initial eccentricity. These binaries are placed in the m12i synthetic Milky-Way-like galaxy, and their signal-to-noise ratio for the LISA instrument is estimated, considering a galactic gravitational wave foreground informed by the population. Through the use of Fisher estimates, we construct a likelihood function for the measurement error of the LISA-bright DWD binaries (> 20 SNR, fGW > 5mHz), in their gravitational wave frequency (fGW) and chirp mass. By repeating this process for different assumptions of the common envelope ejection efficiency, we apply Bayesian hierarchical inference to find the best match to an injected astrophysical assumption for a fiducial population model. We conclude that the impact of common envelope ejection efficiency on the mass transfer processes involved in double white dwarf formation may be statistically relevant in the future observed LISA population, and that constraints on binary formation may be found by comparing simulated populations to a future observed population.",

A novel search strategy is developed, wherein intrinsic achromatic spin wandering is tracked simultaneously with the modulation induced by a single gravitational wave source in the pulse times of arrival. A two-step inference procedure is applied within a state-space framework, such that the modulation is tracked with a Kalman filter, which then provides a likelihood for nested sampling. The procedure estimates the static parameters in the problem, such as the sky position of the source, without fitting for ensemble-averaged statistics such as the power spectral density of the timing noise, and therefore complements traditional parameter estimation methods. It also returns the Bayes factor relating a model with a single gravitational wave source to one without, complementing traditional detection methods. It is shown via astrophysically representative software injections in Gaussian measurement noise that the procedure distinguishes a gravitational wave from pure noise down to a characteristic wave strain of $h_0 \\approx 2 \\times 10^{-15}$.

These studies need a robust foundation in black hole perturbation theory beyond general relativity. While existing studies have employed black hole perturbation theories to explore modifications beyond general relativity, they often focus on specific alternative theories or phenomenological models of quantum gravity. In this paper, we establish a modified decoupled Teukolsky formalism that is broadly applicable to spherically symmetric spacetimes without requiring a predetermined gravitational Lagrangian. This formalism uses the Newman-Penrose framework, which utilizes curvature perturbations characterized by Weyl scalars, to accommodate a wider class of spacetimes beyond general relativity.

This leads to a new hydro frame, where the spectrum contains only hydrodynamic modes. We further show that the resulting stress tensor may have an infinite series in momentum space, with a convergence radius linked to the eliminated non-hydrodynamic mode, illustrating its control over the validity of the hydrodynamic expansion.

    "abstract": "We consider Kundt solutions to vacuum Conformal Killing Gravity (CKG) proposed by Harada and find numerous solutions in four dimensions and in higher dimensions. In CKG theory the cosmological constant appears as an integration constant, and hence, is naturally embedded in the theory. However, by considering Kundt solutions to CKG we seemingly open Pandora's box: We find so many solutions so a selection criterium is needed in CKG to explain the current accelerated expansion of the universe.",

In this manuscript are presented published results on the production of $\\mathrm{K^{0}_{S}}$, $\\Lambda (\\bar\\Lambda)$, $\\Xi^\\pm$ and $\\Omega^\\pm$ hadrons in charged-particle jets and the underlying event in pp and p-Pb collisions measured by ALICE.

    "abstract": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator, has been a pivotal tool in advancing our understanding of fundamental physics. By colliding heavy ions (such as lead ions), the LHC recreates conditions similar to those just after the Big Bang. This allows scientists to study the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a state of matter where quarks and gluons are not confined within protons and neutrons. These studies provide insights into the strong force and the early universe's behavior. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent significant findings from A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) at LHC. The topics encompass measurements regarding to properties of the QGP, particle production, flow and correlations, dileptons, quarkonia and electromagnetic probes, heavy flavor, and jets. Additionally, we introduce future plans for detector upgrades of the ALICE experiment.",

    "abstract": "Astrophysical and cosmological observations strongly suggest the existence of Dark Matter. However, it's fundamental nature is still elusive. Collider experiments at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) offer a promising way to reveal the particle nature of the dark matter. In such an endeavour, we investigate the potential of the mono-Higgs plus missing $E_T$ signature at the LHC to search for dark matter. Without going in a particular Ultra-Violet complete model of dark matter, we have used the framework of Effective Field Theory to describe the dynamics of a relatively light fermionic dark matter candidate, which interacts with the Standard Model via dimension-6 and dimension-7 operators involving the Higgs and the gauge bosons. Both cut-based and Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithms have been used to extract the signal for dark matter production over the Standard Model backgrounds, assuming an integrated luminosity of $3000~fb^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s}~=~14$ TeV at the High Luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC). The BDT is seen to separate the dark matter signal at $5\\sigma$ significance, for masses below 200 GeV, showcasing the prospects of this search at the HL-LHC.",

We calculate the scattering on the rear side of the vacuum pipe by the GEANT4 simulation and trace the electrons back through the magnetic fields to the spectrometer and registration system. The contribution is a few orders of magnitude smaller compared to the original spectrum at the end of the beta-spectrum of 18.6 keV but reaches 2\\% at 11 keV. Taking into account this rear wall scattering we can fit well the measured spectrum in search for a sterile neutrino component in the tritium beta decay.",

    "abstract": "Most of the tracking detectors for high energy particle experiments are filled with silicon detectors since they are radiation hard, they can give very small spatial resolution and they can take advantage of the silicon electronics foundries developments and production lines.   Strip detectors are very useful to cover large areas for tracking purposes, while consuming less power per area compared to pixel sensors. The majority of particle physics experiments use conventional silicon strip detectors fabricated in foundries that do not use stitching, relying on a very small number of foundries worldwide that can provide large amounts of strip detectors. Fabricating strip detectors in a CMOS foundry opens the possibility to use more foundries and to include active elements in the strips for future productions. For the passive CMOS strip detectors project we fabricated strip detectors in a CMOS foundry using two 1 cm2 reticles that are stitched together along the wafer. The fabricated strips stitched the reticles three and five times, and it was shown that the performance of those strips is not affected by the stitching.   This paper shows 3D TCAD simulations of the stitching area to investigate the possible effects stitching can have on the performance of the strip detectors, considering different stitching mismatches. We will show that the mismatch of stitched structures up to 1 um does not impact the performance with TCAD simulations which agrees with the results obtained from the measurements.",

We show that in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field the CME manifests itself via a localized electromagnetic current density along the direction of the field, which integrates to zero over the full volume. Our primary observable is the leading-order coefficient of the current in a chiral chemical potential expansion, which we compute for various lattice spacings and extrapolate to the continuum limit. Our findings demonstrate that, even though the global spatial average of the CME conductivity vanishes in equilibrium, steady currents still exist locally. Thus, spatially modulated magnetic fields provide a possible way of generating a non-trivial CME signal in equilibrium.",

Compared with the pair production channel $\\mu^+\\mu^-\\to H^{++} H^{--}$, the single production channel $\\mu^+\\mu^-\\to \\mu^\\mp\\ell^\\mp H^{\\pm\\pm}$ in principle could probe the mass region above the threshold $m_{H^{\\pm\\pm}}>\\sqrt{s}/2$. The single production channel depends on the Yukawa coupling $h$, which is related to the neutrino oscillation parameters. We show that the Majorana phases $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ have great impact on the individual cross section of the single production. We find that the same sign dilepton signature from $H^{\\pm\\pm}\\to \\ell^\\pm\\ell^\\pm$ could probe $m_{H^{\\pm\\pm}}\\lesssim2.6(7.1)$ TeV at the 3 (10) TeV muon collider when the triplet VEV $v_\\Delta\\lesssim3$ eV.",

    "abstract": "The production of a pair of on-shell $Z$-bosons is an important process at the Large Hadron Collider. Owing to its large production cross section at the LHC, this process is very useful for SM precision studies, electroweak symmetry breaking sector as well as to unravel the possible new physics. In this work, we have performed the threshold resummation of the large logarithms that arise in the partonic threshold limit $z \\to 1$, up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy. The presence of the two-loop contributions in the process dependent resummation coefficient $g_0$ makes the numerical computation a non-trivial task. After matching the resummed predictions to the Next-to-Next-to-Leading order (NNLO) fixed order results, we present the invariant mass distribution to NNLO+NNLL accuracy in QCD for the current LHC energies. We find that in the high invariant mass region ($Q=1$ TeV), while the NNLO corrections are as large as $83\\%$ with respect to the leading order, the NNLL contribution enhances the cross section by additional few percent, about $4\\%$ for $13.6$ TeV LHC. In this invariant mass region, the conventional scale uncertainties in the fixed order results get reduced from $3.4\\%$ at NNLO to about $2.6\\%$ at NNLO+NNLL, and this reduction is expected to be more for higher $Q$ values.",

    "title": "Microsecond-Latency Feedback at a Particle Accelerator by Online Reinforcement Learning on Hardware",
    "abstract": "The commissioning and operation of future large-scale scientific experiments will challenge current tuning and control methods. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are a promising solution thanks to their capability of autonomously tackling a control problem based on a task parameterized by a reward function. The conventionally utilized machine learning (ML) libraries are not intended for microsecond latency applications, as they mostly optimize for throughput performance. On the other hand, most of the programmable logic implementations are meant for computation acceleration, not being intended to work in a real-time environment. To overcome these limitations of current implementations, RL needs to be deployed on-the-edge, i.e. on to the device gathering the training data. In this paper we present the design and deployment of an experience accumulator system in a particle accelerator. In this system deep-RL algorithms run using hardware acceleration and act within a few microseconds, enabling the use of RL for control of ultra-fast phenomena. The training is performed offline to reduce the number of operations carried out on the acceleration hardware. The proposed architecture was tested in real experimental conditions at the Karlsruhe research accelerator (KARA), serving also as a synchrotron light source, where the system was used to control induced horizontal betatron oscillations in real-time. The results showed a performance comparable to the commercial feedback system available at the accelerator, proving the viability and potential of this approach. Due to the self-learning and reconfiguration capability of this implementation, its seamless application to other control problems is possible. Applications range from particle accelerators to large-scale research and industrial facilities.",

    "abstract": "Baryonic two-body $B$ mesons decays have been measured experimentally for some time, which provides an excellent ground for studying the QCD of baryonic $B$ decays. In this work, we investigate the two-body doubly-charmed baryonic $B$ decays in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach including higher twist contributions to the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs). The charmed baryon LCDAs are included up to the twist four and the effect of the subleading component of the $B$ meson LCDAs is studied for details. With the inclusion of these higher-power contributions, the PQCD results on rates can explain the current experimental data well. Moreover, we note that the SU(3) symmetry breaking is important in the concerned processes and play an essential role in understanding the measurements of $\\mathcal{B}(\\overline{B}^0\\to \\Lambda_c^+\\overline \\Lambda_c^-)$ and $ \\mathcal{B}({B}^-\\to\\Xi_c^0\\overline \\Lambda_c^-)$.

Recent works have shown how TNs can also be applied to perform Machine Learning (ML) tasks, yielding comparable results to standard supervised learning techniques. In this work, we study the use of Tree Tensor Networks (TTNs) in high-frequency real-time applications by exploiting the low-latency hardware of the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. We present different implementations of TTN classifiers, capable of performing inference on classical ML datasets as well as on complex physics data. A preparatory analysis of bond dimensions and weight quantization is realized in the training phase, together with entanglement entropy and correlation measurements, that help setting the choice of the TTN architecture. The generated TTNs are then deployed on a hardware accelerator; using an FPGA integrated into a server, the inference of the TTN is completely offloaded. Eventually, a classifier for High Energy Physics (HEP) applications is implemented and executed fully pipelined with sub-microsecond latency.",

This study explores the integration of super-resolution techniques into an LHC-like reconstruction pipeline to effectively enhance the granularity of calorimeter data and suppress noise. We find that this software preprocessing step can significantly improve reconstruction quality without physical changes to detectors. To demonstrate the impact of our approach, we propose a novel particle flow model that offers enhanced particle reconstruction quality and interpretability.

A minimal tuning of GENIE and NuWro based on their default models shows an improvement in the prediction of single $\\pi^0$ production.

    "abstract": "An upgrade of the COSINE-100 experiment, COSINE-100U, has been prepared for installation at Yemilab, a new underground laboratory in Korea, following 6.4 years of operation at the Yangyang Underground Laboratory. The COSINE-100 experiment aimed to investigate the annual modulation signals reported by the DAMA/LIBRA but observed a null result, revealing a more than 3$\\sigma$ discrepancy. COSINE-100U seeks to explore new parameter spaces for dark matter detection using NaI(Tl) detectors. All eight NaI(Tl) crystals, with a total mass of 99.1 kg, have been upgraded to improve light collection efficiency, significantly enhancing dark matter detection sensitivity. This paper describes the detector upgrades, performance improvements, and the enhanced sensitivity to low-mass dark matter detection in the COSINE-100U experiment.",

Findings include a demonstration that the pion near-core pressure is roughly twice that in the proton, so both are significantly greater than that of a neutron star; parton species separations of the nucleon's three gravitational form factors, in which, inter alia, the glue-to-quark ratio for each form factor is seen to take the same constant value, independent of momentum transfer; and a determination of proton radii orderings, with the mechanical (normal force) radius being less than the mass-energy radius, which is less than the proton charge radius. This body of predictions should prove useful in an era of anticipated experiments that will enable them to be tested.",

    "abstract": "Quantum entanglement (QE) and Bell inequalities (BI) have been extensively studied for interactions that conserve parity (P), while their interplay with P-violating ones remains underexplored. We find P violation leads to a preference for particular spin combinations and has significant effects on QE and the extent of BI violation. Within the quantum field theory (QFT) framework, for spin-0 particles decaying into two fermions, parameters for the concurrence and the BI for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt case are found to be $\\sqrt{1 - \\alpha^2}$ and $2 \\sqrt{2 - \\alpha^2}$, respectively, where $-1\\leq \\alpha\\ \\leq 1$ quantifies the size of P violation. For spin-1 particle decays, we find that P-violating interactions introduce effects similar to those in the spin-0 case. Without knowledge from the QFT, for the spin-0 case, the general form of density matrices requires measuring only one parameter for P-conserving decays and three otherwise. For spin-1 cases, there would be nine parameters in general. We further study the overlooked effect on QE and BI induced by the magnetic field in detectors and find it essential for a genuine test of P and CP symmetries.",

    "abstract": "Scalar non-standard neutrino interactions (sNSI) is a scenario where neutrinos can develop a medium dependent contribution to their mass due to a new scalar mediator. This scenario differs from the commonly discussed vector mediator case in that the oscillation effect scales with density rather than density and neutrino energy. Thus the strongest oscillation constraint comes from solar neutrinos which experience the largest density in a neutrino oscillation experiment. We derive constraints on all the sNSI parameters as well as the absolute neutrino mass scale by combining solar and reactor data and find solar neutrinos to be $>1$ order of magnitude more sensitive to sNSI than terrestrial probes such as long-baseline experiments.",

    "title": "New Measurements of the Deuteron to Proton F2 Structure Function Ratio",
    "abstract": "Nucleon structure functions, as measured in lepton-nucleon scattering, have historically provided a critical observable in the study of partonic dynamics within the nucleon. However, at very large parton momenta it is both experimentally and theoretically challenging to extract parton distributions due to the probable onset of non-perturbative contributions and the unavailability of high precision data at critical kinematics. Extraction of the neutron structure and the d-quark distribution have been further challenging due to the necessity of applying nuclear corrections when utilizing scattering data from a deuteron target to extract free neutron structure. However, a program of experiments has been carried out recently at the energy-upgraded Jefferson Lab electron accelerator aimed at significantly reducing the nuclear correction uncertainties on the d-quark distribution function at large partonic momentum. This allows leveraging the vast body of deuterium data covering a large kinematic range to be utilized for d-quark parton distribution function extraction. We present new data from experiment E12-10-002 carried out in Jefferson Lab Hall C on the deuteron to proton cross-section ratio at large BJorken-x. These results significantly improve the precision of existing data, and provide a first look at the expected impact on quark distributions extracted from global parton distribution function fits.",

    "abstract": "Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability occurs in a variety of scenario as a consequence of fluids of different densities pushing against the density gradient. For example, it is expected to occur in the ion acceleration of solid density targets driven by high intensity lasers and is crucial for the acceleration process. Yet, it is essential to understand the dynamics of the RT instability, a typical way to measure this phenomenon requires sophisticated diagnostics such as streak X ray radiography. Here, we report on experimental observation on periodic modulation in the energy spectrum of laser accelerated proton beams. Interestingly, theoretical model and two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, in good agreement with the experimental finding, indicated that such modulation is associated with periodic modulated electron density induced by transverse Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability. Furthermore, the correlation between the RT instability and the ion acceleration provides an interpretation to trace the development of the RT instability from the modulated proton spectrum. Our results thus suggest a possible tool to diagnose the evolution of the RT instability, and may have implications for further understanding for the accelerating mechanisms as well as optimization strategies for laser driven ion acceleration.",

This invalidates many assumptions involved in fitting data sets and determining the best fit values of power-law exponents.

    "abstract": "A measurement of the Higgs boson mass and width via its decay to two Z bosons is presented. Proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$ at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is used. The invariant mass distribution of four leptons in the on-shell Higgs boson decay is used to measure its mass and contrain its width. This yields the most precise single measurement of the Higgs boson mass to date, 125.04 $\\pm$ 0.12 GeV, and an upper limit on the width $\\Gamma_\\mathrm{H}$ $\\lt$ 330 MeV at 95% confidence level. A combination of the on- and off-shell Higgs boson production decaying to four leptons is used to determine the Higgs boson width, assuming that no new virtual particles affect the production, a premise that is tested by adding new heavy particles in the gluon fusion loop model. This result is combined with a previous CMS analysis of the off-shell Higgs boson production with decay to two leptons and two neutrinos, giving a measured Higgs boson width of 3.0$^{+2.0}_{-1.5}$ MeV, in agreement with the standard model prediction of 4.1 MeV. The strength of the off-shell Higgs boson production is also reported.

    "abstract": "Detection of scintillation light in noble liquid detectors is necessary for identifying neutrino interaction candidates from beam, astrophysical, or solar sources. Large monolithic detectors typically have highly efficient detectors, like photomultipliers, mounted outside their electric field. This option is not available for modular detectors that wish to maximize their active volume. The ArgonCube light readout system detectors (ArCLights) are large-area thin wavelength shifting (WLS) panels that can operate in highly proximate modular detectors and within the electric field. The WLS plastic forming the bulk structure of the ArCLight has Tetraphenyl Butadiene (TPB) and sheets of dichroic mirror layered across its surface. It is coupled to a set of six silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). This publication compares TPB coating techniques for large surface areas and describes quality control methods for large scale production.",

    "abstract": "We report the first observation and measurement of antiproton annihilation at rest on argon using the LArIAT experiment. Antiprotons from a charged particle test beam that come to rest inside LArIAT's liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) are identified through beamline instrumentation and LArTPC track reconstruction algorithms. The multiplicity of charged particle tracks originating from the annihilation vertex is manually assessed through hand-scanning, resulting in a distribution with a mean of 3.2 $\\pm$ 0.4 tracks and a standard deviation of 1.3 tracks. This is consistent with an automated track reconstruction, which produces a mean of 2.8 $\\pm$ 0.4 tracks and a standard deviation of 1.2 tracks. Good agreement is found between data and Monte Carlo simulations for both methods. Additionally, we report the shower multiplicity and particle identification of outgoing tracks, both of which align closely with theoretical predictions. These findings will contribute to modeling of intranuclear annihilation interactions on argon, including scenarios such as neutron-antineutron oscillations.",

Neutral LLP production, resulting in a displaced vertex signature inside the ILD's time projection chamber (TPC), is considered. We focus on scenarios interesting from the experimental perspective and perform a search based on displaced vertex finding inside the TPC volume. Two experimentally very challenging types of scenarios are explored: first, involving very soft final states due to a small mass splitting between heavy LLP and a dark matter particle to which the LLP decays, and the second one, with a light LLP production resulting in almost colinear vertex tracks because of a large boost of the LLP. The expected limits on the signal production cross section are presented for a wide range of the LLP proper lifetimes corresponding to $c\\tau$ from 0.1 mm to 10 km.",

    "abstract": "The present investigation reports the design and development of an advanced material with a high figure of merit (FoM) for beampipe applications in particle accelerators by bringing synergy between computational and experimental approaches. Machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the phase(s), low density, and high radiation length of the designed Al-Ti-V alloys. Al-Ti-V alloys with various compositions for single-phase and dual-phase mixtures, liquidus temperature, and density values are obtained using the Latin hypercube sampling method in TC Python Thermo-Calc software. The obtained dataset is utilized to train the machine-learning algorithms. Classification algorithms such as XGBoost and regression models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest regressor have been used to compute the number of phases, radiation length, and density respectively. The XGBoost algorithms show an accuracy of $98\\%$, the Linear regression model shows an accuracy of $94\\%$, and the Random Forest regressor model is accurate up to $99\\%$. The developed Al-Ti-V alloys exhibit high radiation length as well as a good combination of high elastic modulus and toughness due to the synergistic effect of the presence of hard $Al_3Ti$ phase along with a minor volume fraction of FCC $(Al)_{ss}$ solid solution phase mixture. The comparison of our alloys, alloy-1 ($Al_{75.2}Ti_{22.8}V_{2}$) and alloy-2 ($Al_{89}Ti_{10}V_{1}$) shows an increase in the radiation length by seven-times and a decrease in the density by two to three times as compared to stainless steel 304, the preferred material for constructing beampipes in low-energy particle accelerators. Further, we experimentally verify the elastic modulus of the alloy-1 and compute the FoM equal to 0.416, which is better than other existing materials for beampipes in low-energy experiments.",

In this paper, we demonstrate that a selection algorithm optimized by GEP and applied to the top-quark pair production process' semi-leptonic decay channel enables the increase of data purity for already highly pure data.

For the first time, this study sheds light on the charm current and estimates the diffusion matrix coefficient for the charmed states by treating them as a part of the quasi-thermalized medium. We explore the diffusion matrix coefficient as a function of temperature and center-of-mass energy. A van der Waals-like interaction is assumed between the hadrons, including attractive and repulsive interactions. The calculation of diffusion coefficients is based on relaxation time approximation to the Boltzmann transport equation. A good agreement with available model calculations is observed in the hadronic limit. To conclude the study, we discuss, with a detailed explanation, that charm fluctuation is expected to be a better tool for probing the QCD critical point.",

Analyzing data collected over 6.4 years, with improved energy calibration and time-dependent background description, we found no evidence of an annual modulation signal, challenging the DAMA/LIBRA result with a confidence level greater than 3$\\sigma$. This finding represents a significant step toward resolving the long-standing debate surrounding DAMA/LIBRA's dark matter claim, indicating that the observed modulation is unlikely to be caused by dark matter interactions.",

As an application of our analysis, we performed a full quantum tomography of the final state in the $B^0\\to K^{*0}\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decays using data recorded by LHCb collaboration.

SpaCal modules consist of an absorber block containing a matrix of holes filled with scintillating fibres, offering flexible granularity. However, the total number of scintillating fibres exceeds the available photocathode surface area, necessitating the use of a light guide to efficiently collect and register the light from the scintillating fibres to a single photomultiplier. This introduces non-uniformity in the light collection, which adversely impacts energy resolution.   In this study, we explored various geometries of light guides with the optical ray-tracing simulations in order to collect scintillating light from a $30\\times 30$~mm$^2$ surface to the photocathode of photomultipliers with the following entrance window: $18\\times 18$~mm$^2$ (e.g. R7600), $9\\times 9$~mm$^2$ (multi-anode version, e.g. R7600-M4), and round photocathode $\\oslash 8$~mm (e.g. R9880).

    "title": "T-odd observables from anomalous $tbW$ couplings in single-top production at an $ep$ collider",
    "abstract": "We investigate the possibility that an imaginary anomalous $tbW$ coupling can be measured in the process $e^-p \\to \\nu_e \\overline t X$ by means of T-odd observables. One such observable considered here is the polarization of the top antiquark transverse to the production plane. The other is a T-odd correlation constructed out of observable momenta when the top quark decays leptonically. Both these T-odd observables are shown to be proportional to the imaginary part of only one of the $tbW$ anomalous couplings, the other couplings giving either vanishing or negligible contribution. This imaginary part could signal either a CP-odd coupling, or an absorptive part in the effective coupling, or both. We estimate the 1-$\\sigma$ limits that might be derived in the case of each of these observables for a collider with a proton energy of 7 TeV and an electron energy of 60 GeV and also in the case of a higher electron energy of 150 GeV.",

    "title": "Measurement of the inclusive isolated-photon production cross section in pp and Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV",
    "abstract": "The ALICE Collaboration at the CERN LHC has measured the inclusive production cross section of isolated photons at midrapidity as a function of the photon transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}^{\\gamma}$), in Pb-Pb collisions in different centrality intervals, and in pp collisions, at centre-of-momentum energy per nucleon pair of $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. The photon transverse momentum range is between 10-14 and 40-140 GeV/$c$, depending on the collision system and on the Pb-Pb centrality class. The result extends to lower $p_{\\rm T}^{\\gamma}$ than previously published results by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the same collision energy. The covered pseudorapidity range is $|\\eta^{\\gamma}| <0.67$. The isolation selection is based on a charged particle isolation momentum threshold $p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm iso,~ch} = 1.5$ GeV/$c$ within a cone of radii $R=0.2$ and $0.4$. The nuclear modification factor is calculated and found to be consistent with unity in all centrality classes, and also consistent with the HG-PYTHIA model, which describes the event selection and geometry biases that affect the centrality determination in peripheral Pb-Pb collisions. The measurement is compared to next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations and to the measurements of isolated photons and Z$^0$ bosons from the CMS experiment, which are all found to be in agreement.",

    "title": "Potential of Neutrino Telescopes to Detect Quantum Gravity-Induced Decoherence in the Presence of Dark Fermions",
    "abstract": "We assess the potential of neutrino telescopes to discover quantum-gravity-induced decoherence effects modeled in the open-quantum system framework and with arbitrary numbers of active and dark fermion generations, such as particle dark matter or sterile neutrinos. The expected damping of neutrino flavor oscillation probabilities as a function of energy and propagation length thus encodes information about quantum gravity effects and the fermion generation multiplicity in the dark sector. We employ a public Monte-Carlo dataset by the IceCube Collaboration to model the detector response and estimate the sensitivity of IceCube to oscillation effects induced by the presented model. Our findings confirm the potential of very-large-volume neutrino telescopes to test this class of models and indicate higher sensitivities for increasing numbers of dark fermions.",

The data are consistent with receiving contributions from a mixture of $\\it{\\Lambda}$ resonances with different spin-parity quantum numbers.

    "title": "Efficient transmutation of long-lived fission products in a Gamma Factory beam driven advanced nuclear energy system",
    "abstract": "The Gamma Factory (GF) project aims to generate high-intensity $\\gamma$-ray beams of tunable energy and relatively small energy spread. Such beams can be optimized to generate an intense photo-neutron source, capable of driving an advanced nuclear energy system (ANES) for nuclear waste transmutation and supplying electrical power that is necessary for the GF operation mode of the Large Hadron Collider storage ring. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of driving ANES with the GF beam which is optimized to maximize the neutron production rate. The dependence of the ANES thermal power on the distance between the positions of the ANES and the GF $\\gamma$-ray source is evaluated. For the $\\gamma$-ray beam reaching the intensity of $\\sim$$10^{19}$ photons per second, the ANES thermal power could exceed $500\\,$MWt. Under the assumption that ANES operates over $20$ years, the transmutation rate could reach $30\\%$ for five typical long-lived fission products (LLFPs): $^{79}$Se, $^{99}$Tc, $^{107}$Pd, $^{129}$I, $^{137}$Cs. Our comparative studies show that although the neutron production efficiency of the GF $\\gamma$-ray beam (per MW of the beam power) is approximately $14$ times lower than that of the $500\\,$MeV proton beam, the overall net ANES power production efficiency for the GF beam driver scheme could be comparable to that of the proton beam driver scheme, while providing additional transmutation capacity, not available for the proton beam driven scheme. It is suggested that the GF-based ANES could provide a viable solution for the efficient transmutation of LLFPs without isotopic separation.",

    "title": "$\u03bd$-point energy correletors with FastEEC: small-$x$ physics from LHC jets",
    "abstract": "In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as a powerful tool for studying jet substructure, with promising applications such as probing the hadronization transition, analyzing the quark-gluon plasma, and improving the precision of top quark mass measurements. The projected $N$-point correlator measures correlations between $N$ final-state particles by tracking the largest separation between them, showing a scaling behavior related to DGLAP splitting functions. These correlators can be analytically continued in $N$, commonly referred to as $\\nu$-correlators, allowing access to non-integer moments of the splitting functions. Of particular interest is the $\\nu \\to 0$ limit, where the small momentum fraction behavior of the splitting functions requires resummation. Originally, the computational complexity of evaluating $\\nu$-correlators for $M$ particles scaled as $2^{2M}$, making it impractical for real-world analyses. However, by using recursion, we reduce this to $M 2^M$, and through the FastEEC method of dynamically resolving subjets, $M$ is replaced by the number of subjets. This breakthrough enables, for the first time, the computation of $\\nu$-correlators for LHC data. In practice, limiting the number of subjets to 16 is sufficient to achieve percent-level precision, which we validate using known integer-$\\nu$ results and convergence tests for non-integer $\\nu$. We have implemented this in an update to FastEEC and conducted an initial study of power-law scaling in the perturbative regime as a function of $\\nu$, using CMS Open Data on jets. The results agree with DGLAP evolution, except at small $\\nu$, where the anomalous dimension saturates to a value that matches the BFKL anomalous dimension. This work is meant as a first step towards detailed experimental measurements and precision theoretical studies.",

    "title": "Towards an unbiased jet energy loss measurement",
    "abstract": "The modifications imprinted on jets due to their interaction with Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) are assessed by comparing samples of jets produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions and proton-proton collisions. The standard procedure ignores the effect of bin migration by comparing specific observables for jet populations at the same reconstructed jet transverse momentum ($p_T$). Since jet $p_T$ is itself modified by interaction with QGP, all such comparisons confound QGP induced modifications with changes that are simply a consequence of comparing jets that started out differently. The quantile matching procedure introduced by Brewer et al. directly estimates average fractional jet energy loss ($Q_{AA}$) and can thus mitigate this $p_T$ migration effect. In this work, we validate the procedure in more realistic scenarios that include medium response. We study the evolution of $Q_{AA}$ with jet radius, its sensitivity to minimum particle $p_T$ and medium response as implemented in two different models for jet evolution in heavy-ion collisions. Further, we use this procedure to establish that the difference between inclusive jet and $\\gamma+$jet nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) is dominated by differences in the spectral shape, leaving the colour charge of the jet initiating parton with a lesser role to play. Additionally, we compare $Q_{AA}$ to an experimentally proposed proxy for fractional jet energy loss, $S_{loss}$, showing that both quantities are similar, although the former provides a more clear physical interpretation. Finally, we show the size of the $p_T$ migration correction for four different substructure observables and how to reliably use the quantile procedure experimentally to improve existing measurements.",

This method leverages the simple structure of LC integrands, enabling optimized phase-space parameterisations and resulting in high primary unweighting efficiencies, ranging from the percent level for $2 \\to 4$ processes to the per-mille level for $2 \\to 7$ processes. Given that the LC-accurate matrix elements closely approximate the FC-accurate ones, the secondary unweighting efficiencies exceed 50%.

    "abstract": "Measurements of the polarization and spin correlation in top quark pairs ($\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$) are presented using events with a single electron or muon and jets in the final state. The measurements are based on proton-proton collision data from the LHC at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. All coefficients of the polarization vectors and the spin correlation matrix are extracted simultaneously by performing a binned likelihood fit to the data. The measurement is performed inclusively and in bins of additional observables, such as the mass of the $\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$ system and the top quark scattering angle in the $\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$ rest frame. The measured polarization and spin correlation are in agreement with the standard model. From the measured spin correlation, conclusions on the $\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$ spin entanglement are drawn by applying the Peres-Horodecki criterion.

    "abstract": "In ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions, the photoproduction of high-energy jets can be used to constrain nuclear parton distributions for a wide range of parton kinematics.

Triple-differential cross-sections, unfolded for detector response, are measured and presented using two sets of kinematic variables.

    "abstract": "To explore the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transitions and the properties of quark$-$gluon plasma, the ALICE collaboration at CERN has conducted an extensive analysis of the correlations among net-conserved quantities, namely net-baryon, net-charge, and net-strangeness. These correlations are essential for understanding the QCD phase structure, as they are directly connected to ratios of thermodynamic susceptibilities calculated in lattice QCD. This analysis focuses on the correlations between net-kaon and net-proton, as well as net-kaon and net-charge, in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, where net-proton and net-kaon serve as effective proxies for net-baryon and net-strangeness, respectively. A comparison with theoretical predictions from the Thermal-FIST model sheds light on the role of resonance decays and the effects of charge conservation laws in shaping these correlations. Furthermore, the measurements show sensitivity to the correlation volume in which these conservation laws are applied, underscoring the importance of modeling the underlying dynamics to fully understand the experimental results on fluctuations and correlations in heavy-ion collisions.",

Novel trigger, reconstruction, and machine-learning techniques were developed for and employed in this search. After all selections, the observations are consistent with the background predictions. Limits are presented on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to long-lived particles that subsequently decay to quark pairs or tau lepton pairs. An improvement by up to a factor of 10 is achieved over previous limits for models with long-lived particle masses smaller than 60 GeV and proper decay lengths smaller than 1 m. The first constraints are placed on the fraternal twin Higgs and folded supersymmetry models, where the lower bounds on the top quark partner mass reach up to 350 GeV for the fraternal twin Higgs model and 250 GeV for the folded supersymmetry model.",

    "abstract": "We have performed a global extraction of the ${\\rm ^{12}C}$ longitudinal (${\\cal R}_L$) and transverse (${\\cal R}_T$) nuclear electromagnetic response functions from an analysis of all available electron scattering data on carbon. The response functions are extracted for energy transfer $\\nu$, spanning the nuclear excitation, quasielastic (QE), resonance and inelastic continuum over a large range of the square of the four-momentum transfer ($Q^2$), for fixed values of $Q^2$ and for fixed values of 3-momentum transfer $\\bf q$. The data sample consists of approximately 10,000 differential electron scattering and photo-absorption-cross section measurement points for ${\\rm ^{12}C}$. In addition, we perform a universal fit to all ${\\rm ^{12}C}$ electron scattering data which also provides parmeterizations of ${\\cal R}_L$ and ${\\cal R}_T$ over a larger kinematic range. Since the extracted response functions and the universal fit cover a large range of $Q^2$ and $\\nu$, they can be readily used for comparison to theoretical predictions as well as validating and tuning Monte Carlo generators for electron and neutrino scattering experiments. In this paper we focus on the nuclear excitation, QE, and $\\Delta$(1232) regions and compare the measurements to predictions of the following theoretical approaches: ``Energy Dependent-Relativistic Mean Field'' (ED-RMF), ``Green's Function Monte Carlo'' (GFMC), \"Short Time Approximation Quantum Monte Carlo\" (STA-QMC), \"Correlated Fermi Gas\" (CFG), as well as the {\\textsc{NuWro}}, \\ {{\\sc{achilles}}}~ and {{\\sc{genie}}}~generators.

We show that these hadronic showers also produce neutrons; their captures can be detected with high efficiency due to the recent addition of dissolved gadolinium to Super-Kamiokande. We show that new cuts based on the neutron tagging of showers could reduce spallation backgrounds by a factor of at least four beyond present cuts. With further work, this could lead to a near-elimination of detector backgrounds above about 6 MeV, which would significantly improve the sensitivity of Super-Kamiokande. These findings heighten the importance of adding gadolinium to Hyper-Kamiokande, which is at a shallower depth. Further, a similar approach could be used in other detectors, for example, the JUNO liquid-scintillator detector, which is also at a shallower depth.",

In this regard, it is important to define the 'standard' as precisely as possible. This work continues previous studies within the framework of the Generalized Eikonal Approximation (GEA). The focus is on processes where the participating protons experience multiple soft rescattering on the spectator neutron. It is shown that correct treatment of deviations of the trajectories of outgoing protons from the longitudinal direction leads to a significant modification of partial amplitudes with soft rescattering of two outgoing protons and non-vanishing amplitudes with rescattering of incoming and outgoing protons.

Conventionally, $\\mu\\rightarrow e$ conversion experiments are optimized to detect electrons originating from transitions where the nucleus remains in the ground state, thereby maximizing the energy of the outgoing electron. Clearly, detection of a positive signal in forthcoming experiments would stimulate additional work $-$ including subsequent conversion experiments using complementary nuclear targets $-$ to further constrain the new physics responsible for CLFV. Here we argue that additional information can be extracted without the need for additional experiments, by considering inelastic conversion in $^{27}$Al. Transitions to low-lying nuclear excited states can modify the near-endpoint spectrum of conversion electrons, with the ratio of the elastic and inelastic responses being sensitive to the underlying CLFV operator. We extend the nuclear effective theory of $\\mu\\rightarrow e$ conversion to the inelastic case, which adds five new response functions to the six that arise for the elastic process. We evaluate these nuclear response functions in $^{27}$Al and calculate the resulting conversion-electron signal, taking into account the resolution anticipated in Mu2e/COMET.

    "title": "Fuzzy logic for reconstructing arbitrary moments of multiplicity distributions",
    "abstract": "The Identity Method is a statistical technique developed to reconstruct moments of multiplicity distributions of particles produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. The method leverages principles from fuzzy logic, allowing for a more nuanced representation of particle identification by assigning degrees of membership to different particle types based on detector signals. In this contribution, a mathematical framework, based on a multivariate moment generation function, is developed that allows the derivation of the formulas used in the Identity Method in a more robust way. Moreover, within the introduced framework, the Identity Method is easily extended to cope with arbitrarily higher-order moments. The techniques developed here offer significant potential for improving the accuracy of multiplicity distribution analyses in high-energy nuclear collisions. While the primary focus of the work presented is on applications in high-energy and nuclear physics, it can also be applied in other areas where signal identification is probabilistic and data are noisy, such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and various other fields of experimental science.",

    "abstract": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the extractions of properties of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) are hindered by a limited understanding of its initial conditions, where the nuclear structure of the colliding ions play a significant role. In these proceedings, we present the first quantitative demonstration using ``collective flow assisted nuclear shape imaging\" method to extract the quadrupole deformation and triaxiality from $^{238}$U using data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). We achieve this by comparing bulk observables in $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U collisions with nearly spherical $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au collisions. A similar comparative measurement performed in collisions of $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr, suggests the presence of moderate quadrupole deformation of $^{96}$Ru, large octupole deformation of $^{96}$Zr, as well as an apparent neutron skin difference between these two species. The prospect of this nuclear shape imaging method as a novel tool for the study of nuclear structure is also elaborated.",

    "abstract": "The critical phenomena of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the square lattice with $q=2,3,4$ are investigated using the techniques of neural networks (NN). In particular, an unconventional supervised NN which is trained using no information about the physics of the considered systems is employed. In addition, conventional unsupervised autoencoders (AECs) are used in our study as well. Remarkably, while the conventional AECs fail to uncover the critical phenomena of the systems investigated here, our unconventional supervised NN correctly identifies the critical behaviors of all three considered antiferromagnetic $q$-state models. The results obtained in this study suggest convincingly that the applicability of our unconventional supervised NN is broader than one anticipates. In particular, when a new system is studied with our NN, it is likely that it is not necessary to conduct any training, and one only needs to examine whether an appropriate reduced representation of the original raw configurations exists, so that the same already trained NN can be employed to explore the related phase transition efficiently.",

Within the framework of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), this approach allows for the extraction of detailed information about nucleon tomography and the total angular momentum carried by valence quarks.

We show that in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field the CME manifests itself via a localized electromagnetic current density along the direction of the field, which integrates to zero over the full volume. Our primary observable is the leading-order coefficient of the current in a chiral chemical potential expansion, which we compute for various lattice spacings and extrapolate to the continuum limit. Our findings demonstrate that, even though the global spatial average of the CME conductivity vanishes in equilibrium, steady currents still exist locally. Thus, spatially modulated magnetic fields provide a possible way of generating a non-trivial CME signal in equilibrium.",

However, these two requirements make the determination of PDFs from lattice data very challenging. We present the application of generative machine learning algorithms to estimate the polarized and unpolarized gluon correlation functions utilizing short-distance data and extending the correlation up to $zp_z \\lesssim 14$, surpassing the current capabilities of lattice QCD calculations. We train physics-informed machine learning algorithms to learn from the short-distance correlation at $z\\lesssim 0.36$ fm and take the limit, $p_z \\to \\infty$, thereby minimizing possible contamination from the higher-twist effects for a successful reconstruction of the polarized gluon PDF. We also expose the bias and problems with underestimating uncertainties associated with the use of model-dependent and overly constrained functional forms, such as $x^\\alpha(1-x)^\\beta$ and its variants to extract PDFs from the lattice data.

    "abstract": "Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be employed to understand a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particle scattering in high-energy physics to effective descriptions of many-body interactions in materials. Studying dynamical properties of emergent phases can be challenging as it requires solving many-body problems that are generally beyond perturbative limits. We investigate the dynamics of local excitations in a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT using a two-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits. We first construct a simple variational circuit which prepares low-energy states that have a large overlap with the ground state; then we create particles with local gates and simulate their quantum dynamics via a discretized time evolution. As the effective magnetic field is increased, our measurements show signatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined excitations, the magnetic field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, while for strong confinement transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen. In addition, we demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated. Our LGT implementation on a quantum processor presents a novel set of techniques for investigating emergent particle and string dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Spatially modulated symmetries have emerged since the discovery of fractons, which characterize unconventional topological phases with mobility-constrained quasiparticle excitations. On the other hand, non-invertible duality defects have attracted substantial attention in communities of high energy and condensed matter physics due to their deep insight into quantum anomalies and exotic phases of matter. However, the connection between these exotic symmetries and defects has not been fully explored. In this paper, we construct concrete lattice models with non-invertible duality defects via gauging spatially modulated symmetries and investigate their exotic fusion rules. Specifically, we construct spin models with subsystem symmetries or dipole symmetries on one, two, and three-dimensional lattices. Gauging subsystem symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects whose fusion rules involve $0$-form subsystem charges in two dimensions and higher-form operators that correspond to ``lineon'' excitations (excitations which are mobile along one-dimensional line) in three dimensions. Gauging dipole symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects with dipole algebras that describe a hierarchical structure between global and dipole charges. Notably, the hierarchical structure of the dual dipole charges is inverted compared with the original ones. Our work provides a unified and systematic analytical framework for constructing exotic duality defects by gauging relevant symmetries.",

The plaquette interaction appears naturally as a ring-exchange term in the low-energy description of exciton Bose liquids, cold atomic gases, and quantum dimer models. Using first-principle Monte Carlo simulations, we study the phase diagram and the vortex dynamics in the XY-plaquette model on a square lattice in two spatial dimensions. In its minimal formulation, the model contains a ring-exchange plaquette term in two spatial dimensions and a standard XY-link term in the (imaginary) time direction. We show that the phase diagram of the minimal XY-plaquette model possesses two phases: (i) a disordered vortex-dominated phase in which a single percolating vortex trajectory occupies the whole 3d spacetime; (ii) a partially disordered phase in which the vortices become partially immobile, with their worldlines strictly confined to one or several infinite two-dimensional planes. The spatial positions and spatial orientations (along $x$ or $y$ axis) of these vortex domain walls appear to be spontaneous. Individual vortices form a disordered system within each vortex domain wall, so the fractal spacetime dimension of vortex trajectories approaches $D_f = 2$. We argue that the appearance of the vortex walls could be interpreted as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of a global internal symmetry in the compact XY-plaquette model.",

At the physical pion mass, we find a virtual bound state with a binding energy $\\Delta E=-0.06 \\left(^{+1.30}_{-2.20}\\right) \\left(^{+0.50}_{-1.11}\\right)$. Moreover, we extract from a global analysis both, the light and heavy quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}$ pole, and study the role of the $\\rho$ and $\\pi$ meson exchanges.",

In this work we develop a general strategy to run Schwinger model dynamics on synthetic quantum spin lattices, such as neutral-atom or superconducting-qubit arrays. Our construction encodes the constrained fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom of the model into the geometric shape of a magnetic interface. We show that global magnetic field patterns can drive coherent quantum dynamics of the interface equivalent to the lattice Schwinger Hamiltonian. We rigorously establish that the optimal array required for simulating real-time wave packet collisions and string fragmentation processes with accuracy $\\epsilon$ in the continuum field-theory limit, is a quasi-one-dimensional ribbon with polynomial length and polylogarithmic width in $\\epsilon^{-1}$.

    "abstract": "Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\\Delta=3\\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.",

Each of the two lattice charges generates an ordinary U(1) global symmetry that acts locally on operators and can be gauged individually. Interestingly, they do not commute on a finite lattice, but their commutator goes to zero in the continuum limit. This non-abelian algebra presents an alternative lattice realization of the vector and axial symmetries, which is consistent with the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We further prove that the presence of these two conserved lattice charges forces the low-energy phase to be gapless, reminiscent of the consequence from perturbative anomalies of continuous global symmetries in continuum field theory. Upon bosonization, these two charges lead to two exact U(1) symmetries in the XY model that flow to the momentum and winding symmetries in the free boson conformal field theory.",

To test sensitivity of results to a chosen gluon-exchange (GE) potential, three types of $V_{ge}(r)$ are considered. In first case the non-screened GE potential with large vector coupling at asymptotic, $\\alpha_{\\rm V}(\\rm asym.)=0.635$, and the $c$-quark mass $m_c=1.430$ GeV are taken; in second case a screened $V_{ge}$ and $m_c=1.385$ are investigated, and in third case the GE potential is totally suppressed, $V_{ge}=0$, and $m_c=1.32$ GeV. The agreement with experiment is reached only if the same (universal) flattened confining potential, introduced in the analysis of the radial Regge trajectories of light mesons, is used. The unobserved $6P,0^+$ resonance with the mass $\\cong 4.81$ GeV, near $J/\\psi\\phi(1680)$ threshold, is predicted. Our analysis shows that the screening of the GE potential is possible but weakly affects the physical results obtained. The calculated two-photon decay widths weakly differ in the three cases but may become an important factor, which distinguishes $c\\bar c$ and four-quark states.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate how to construct a fully gauge-fixed lattice Hamiltonian for a pure SU(2) gauge theory. Our work extends upon previous work, where a formulation of an SU(2) lattice gauge theory was developed that is efficient to simulate at all values of the gauge coupling. That formulation utilized maximal-tree gauge, where all local gauge symmetries are fixed and a residual global gauge symmetry remains. By using the geometric picture of an SU(2) lattice gauge theory as a system of rotating rods, we demonstrate how to fix the remaining global gauge symmetry. In particular, the quantum numbers associated with total charge can be isolated by rotating between the lab and body frames using the three Euler angles. The Hilbert space in this new `sequestered' basis partitions cleanly into sectors with differing total angular momentum, which makes gauge-fixing to a particular total charge sector trivial, particularly for the charge-zero sector. In addition to this sequestered basis inheriting the property of being efficient at all values of the coupling, we show that, despite the global nature of the final gauge-fixing procedure, this Hamiltonian can be simulated using quantum resources scaling only polynomially with the lattice volume.",

By applying chemical potential and temperature gradients, we achieve nonzero charge currents, with each gradient leading to distinct Fermi level dependencies, both of which have been observed in a recent experiment.

    "abstract": "Lattice gauge theories, the discretized cousins of continuum gauge theories, have become an important platform for the exploration of non-equilibrium phenomena beyond their original scope in the Standard Model. In particular, recent works have reported the possibility of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model. Using degenerate perturbation theory and numerical simulations based on exact diagonalization and matrix product states, we perform a detailed characterization of thermalization breakdown in the Schwinger model including its spectral properties, the structure of eigenstates, and out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics. We scrutinize the strong-coupling limit of the model, in which an intriguing, double-logarithmic-in-time, growth of entanglement was previously proposed from the initial vacuum state. We identify the origin of this ultraslow growth of entanglement as due to an approximate Hilbert space fragmentation and the emergence of a dynamical constraint on particle hopping, which gives rise to sharp jumps in the entanglement entropy dynamics within individual background charge sectors. Based on the statistics of jump times, we argue that the entanglement growth, averaged over charge sectors, is more naturally explained as either single-logarithmic or a weak power law in time. Our results thus suggest the existence of a single ergodicity-breaking regime due to Hilbert space fragmentation, whose properties are reminiscent of conventional many-body localization within the numerically accessible system sizes.",

Naively using perturbative results to judge when gamma=1 leads to the possibility of large dynamically generated mass hierarchies in models with both two index symmetric representation and fundamental representation fermions. In this paper we study a holographic model of this physics to predict the separation in scales in the meson spectrum. We study SU(Nc) theories at different Nc with one flavour of two index symmetric representation as a function of the number of fundamental fermion flavours NfF. The largest hierarchy we find is for Nc=7 and NfF=22 where the rho mesons made of the two different representations are separated in scale by a factor of 13. For general Nc the hierarchy can be made greater than 7 by tuning NfF. We display the hierarchy as a function of NfF and investigate the quark mass dependence. These predictions do depend on the extrapolation of gamma from the perturbative regime - even in a pessimistic scenario a distinct gap can be achieved.",

In particular, the fine-tunings for quartic couplings are studied in detail through both continuum and lattice perturbation theory at one-loop level. For the lattice version of SQCD we make use of the Wilson gauge action for gluon fields and the Wilson fermion action for fermion fields (quarks, gluinos); for squark fields we use na\\\"ive discretization. On the lattice, different components of squark fields mix among themselves and a total of ten quartic terms arise at the quantum level. Consequently, the renormalization conditions must take into account these effects in order to appropriately fine-tune all quartic couplings. All our results for Green's functions and renormalization factors exhibit an explicit analytic dependence on the number of colors, $N_c$, the number of flavors, $N_f$, and the gauge parameter, $\\alpha$, which are left unspecified. Results for the specific case $N_f=1$ are also presented, where the symmetries allow only five linearly independent quartic terms. For the calculation of the Green's functions, we consider both one-particle reducible and one-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams.

In this paper, we show that the absence of diffeomorphism invariance could be replaced by requiring translational invariance in the tangent space by enlarging the tangent space from SO(d) to the inhomogeneous Lorentz group ISO(d) to include translations. We obtain the ISO(d) symmetry by taking instead the Lie group SO(d + 1) and perform on it Inonu-Wigner contraction.

In this work, we study the ability of quantum algorithms to prepare ground states in a matter-free non-Abelian $SO(3)$ lattice gauge theory in $2+1$D in a phase where the global charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is challenging for two reasons: the necessity of dealing with a large Hilbert space for gauge theories compared to that of quantum spin models, and the closing of the gap between the two ground states which becomes exponentially small as a function of the volume. To deal with the large Hilbert space of gauge fields, we demonstrate how the exact imposition of the non-Abelian Gauss Law in the rishon representation of the quantum link operator significantly reduces the degrees of freedom. Further, to resolve the gap, we introduce symmetry-guided ans\\\"{a}tze in the Gauss-Law-resolved basis for trial states as the starting point for the quantum algorithms to prepare the two lowest energy states. In addition to simulation results for a range of two-dimensional system sizes, we also provide experimental results from the trapped-ion-based quantum hardware, IonQ, when working on systems with four quantum links.

    "title": "An efficient finite-resource formulation of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories beyond one dimension",
    "abstract": "Non-Abelian gauge theories provide an accurate description of fundamental interactions, as both perturbation theory and quantum Monte Carlo computations in lattice gauge theory, it when applicable, show remarkable agreement with experimental data from particle colliders and cosmological observations. Complementing these computations, or combining them with quantum-inspired Hamiltonian lattice computations on quantum machines to improve continuum limit predictions with current quantum resources, is a formidable open challenge. Here, we propose a resource-efficient method to compute the running of the coupling in non-Abelian gauge theories beyond one spatial dimension. We first represent the Hamiltonian on periodic lattices in terms of loop variables and conjugate loop electric fields, exploiting the Gauss law to retain the gauge-independent ones. Then, we identify a local basis for small and large loops variationally to minimize the truncation error while computing the running of the coupling on small tori. Our method enables computations at arbitrary values of the bare coupling and lattice spacing with current quantum computers, simulators and tensor-network calculations, in regimes otherwise inaccessible.",

    "abstract": "The problem of obtaining spectral densities from lattice data has been receiving great attention due to its importance in our understanding of scattering processes in Quantum Field Theory, with applications both in the Standard Model and beyond. The problem is notoriously difficult as it amounts to performing an inverse Laplace transform, starting from a finite set of noisy data. Several strategies are now available to tackle this inverse problem. In this work, we discuss how Backus-Gilbert methods, in particular the variation introduced by some of the authors, relate to the solution based on Gaussian Processes. Both methods allow computing spectral densities smearing with a kernel, whose features depend on the detail of the algorithm. We will discuss such kernel, and show how Backus-Gilbert methods can be understood in a Bayesian fashion. As a consequence of this correspondence, we are able to interpret the algorithmic parameters of Backus-Gilbert methods as hyperparameters in the Bayesian language, which can be chosen by maximising a likelihood function. By performing a comparative study on lattice data, we show that, when both frameworks are set to compute the same quantity, the results are generally in agreement. Finally, we adopt a strategy to systematically validate both methodologies against pseudo-data, using covariance matrices measured from lattice simulations. In our setup, we find that the determination of the algorithmic parameters based on a stability analysis provides results that are, on average, more conservative than those based on the maximisation of a likelihood function.",

    "abstract": "The simulation of quantum lattice gauge theories faces the major challenge of maintaining gauge invariance, as various errors in the simulation push the state of the system out of the physical subspace of the system's exponentially larger Hilbert space. This paper outlines a method, based off of previous work, that uses gauge transformations in two ways. Firstly, the method exploits the Zeno effect by conducting frequent projections to suppress gauge drift. These projections utilize local gauge transformations to destructively interfere unphysical amplitudes via coupling to an ancillary qubit while the physical amplitudes are left untouched, up to a less than unity normalization factor. Secondly, gauge transformations are conducted throughout the time evolution of the system to hamper the speed of gauge drift. This paper demonstrates this method on a pure 1D SU$(2)$ toy model.",

This allows us to numerically compute the local metric along with zweibeins, which subsequently leads to a derivation of discrete curvature defined at every triangle or face.

The simultaneous solution for a modest number of right hand sides concurrently allows for a significant reduction in the time spent solving the coarse grid operator in a multigrid preconditioner. We introduce a preconditioned block conjuate gradient with a multigrid preconditioner, giving additional algorithmic benefit from the multiple right hand sides. There is also a very significant additional to computation rate benefit to multiple right hand sides. This both increases the arithmetic intensity in the coarse space and increases the amount of work being performed in each subroutine call, leading to excellent performance on modern GPU architectures. Further, the software implementation makes use of vendor linear algebra routines (batched GEMM) that can make use of high throughput tensor hardware on recent Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPUs. The cost of the coarse space is made sub-dominant in this algorithm, and benchmarks from the Frontier supercomputer system show up to a factor of twenty speed up over the standard red-black preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm on a large system with physical quark masses.",

    "abstract": "We develop a hybrid oscillator-qubit processor framework for quantum simulation of strongly correlated fermions and bosons that avoids the boson-to-qubit mapping overhead encountered in qubit hardware. This framework gives exact decompositions of particle interactions such as density-density terms and gauge-invariant hopping, as well as approximate methods based on the Baker-Campbell Hausdorff formulas including the magnetic field term for the $U(1)$ quantum link model in $(2+1)$D. We use this framework to show how to simulate dynamics using Trotterisation, perform ancilla-free partial error detection using Gauss's law, measure non-local observables, estimate ground state energies using a oscillator-qubit variational quantum eigensolver as well as quantum signal processing, and we numerically study the influence of hardware errors in circuit QED experiments. To show the advantages over all-qubit hardware, we perform an end-to-end comparison of the gate complexity for the gauge-invariant hopping term and find an improvement of the asymptotic scaling with the boson number cutoff $S$ from $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(S)^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ in our framework as well as, for bosonic matter, a constant factor improvement of better than $10^4$. We also find an improvement from $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(S))$ to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ for the $U(1)$ magnetic field term. While our work focusses on an implementation in superconducting hardware, our framework can also be used in trapped ion, and neutral atom hardware.

Continuous transitions with the same symmetry-breaking pattern are observed in the SU(2) lattice gauge model for $N_f \\ge 30$. Here we present a detailed finite-size scaling analysis of the Monte Carlo data for several large values of $N_f$. The results are in substantial agreement with the field-theoretical predictions obtained in the large-$N_f$ limit.

    "title": "High Energy Physics from Low Energy Physics",
    "abstract": "The separation between physics at low and high energies is essential for physics to have any utility; the details of quantum gravity are not necessary to calculate the trajectory of a cannon ball. However, physics at low and high energies are not completely independent, and this thesis explores two ways that they are related. The first is through a UV/IR symmetry that relates scattering processes at low and high energies. This UV/IR symmetry manifests in geometrical properties of the $S$-matrix, and of the RG flow of the coupling constants in the corresponding effective field theory. Low energy nuclear physics nearly realizes this UV/IR symmetry, providing an explanation for the smallness of shape parameters in the effective range expansion of nucleon-nucleon scattering, and inspiring a new way to organize the interactions between neutrons and protons. The second is through the use of quantum computers to simulate lattice gauge theories. Quantum simulations rely on the universality of the rules of quantum mechanics, which can be applied equally well to describe a (low energy) transmon qubit at 15 milli-Kelvin as a (high energy) 1 TeV quark. This thesis presents the first simulations of one dimensional lattice quantum chromodynamics on a quantum computer, culminating in a real-time simulation of beta-decay. Results from the first simulations of a lattice gauge theory on 100+ qubits of a quantum computer are also presented. The methods developed in this thesis for quantum simulation are ``physics-aware\", and are guided by the symmetries and hierarchies in length scales of the systems being studied. Without these physics-aware methods, 100+ qubit simulations of lattice gauge theories would not have been possible on the noisy quantum computers that are presently available.",

We compare matrix elements for each operators for both nucleon and pseudo-scalar mesons, both pion masses, and two gauge-smearing techniques. Focusing on the more phenomenologically studied nucleon gluon PDF, we compare the ratio and hybrid-ratio renormalized matrix elements at both pion masses and both smearings to those reconstructed from the nucleon gluon PDF from the CT18 global analysis. We identify the best choice of operator to study the gluon PDF through LaMET and present the first gluon quasi-PDF under some caveats. Additionally, we explore the recent idea of Coulomb gauge fixing to improve signal at large Wilson line displacement and found it could be a major help in improving the signal of gluon matrix elements given the perturbative calculation to confirm our results. This work helps identify the best operator for studying the gluon quasi-PDF, shows higher hadron boost momentum is needed to implement hybrid-ratio renormalization reliably, and suggests the need to study more diverse set of operators with their corresponding perturbative calculations for hybrid-ratio renormalization to further gluon quasi-PDF study.",

The study delves into the Landau gauge gluon propagator and the dynamical generation of gluon mass, as well as the dressed-quark propagator and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. It also tackles the baryon bound state problem through the Poincar\\'e-covariant Faddeev equation, analyzing the composition and masses of octet and decuplet baryons. The document concludes with a discussion on the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon and its first radial excitation, providing insights into the quark-diquark structure within baryons.",

    "abstract": "Recently the asymptotic lattice spacing dependence of spectral quantities in lattice QCD has been computed to $\\mathrm{O}(a^2)$ using Symanzik Effective theory [1,2]. Here, we extend these results to matrix elements and correlators of local fermion bilinears, namely the scalar, pseudo-scalar, vector, axial-vector, and tensor. This resembles the typical current insertions for the effective Hamiltonian of electro-weak or BSM contributions, but is only a small fraction of the local fields typically considered.

Exploiting heavy-quark spin symmetry, we show that the LCDAs for a heavy pseudoscalar and vector meson in the context of HQET exhibit degeneracy, and the degeneracy allows for the utilization of quasi DAs for both pseudoscalar and vector mesons on the lattice. We then derive the relevant short-distance coefficients for the matching between LCDAs defined with QCD fields and HQET LCDAs at the one-loop level. The incorporation of these three quasi DAs can not only confirm the methodology introduced in Ref.~\\cite{Han:2024min} but also provides possible insight into power corrections.

Currently, the primary methods for constructing BEs are the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) and the sparse oracle approach. In this work, we demonstrate that QSP-based techniques, such as Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) and Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation for Unitary Matrices (QETU), can themselves be efficiently utilized for BE implementation. Specifically, we present several examples of using QSVT and QETU algorithms, along with their combinations, to block encode Hamiltonians for lattice bosons, an essential ingredient in simulations of high-energy physics. We also introduce a straightforward approach to BE based on the exact implementation of Linear Operators Via Exponentiation and LCU (LOVE-LCU). We find that, while using QSVT for BE results in the best asymptotic gate count scaling with the number of qubits per site, LOVE-LCU outperforms all other methods for operators acting on up to $\\lesssim11$ qubits, highlighting the importance of concrete circuit constructions over mere comparisons of asymptotic scalings.

    "abstract": "The unitary Fermi gas (UFG) is a strongly correlated system of two-species (spin-1/2) fermions with a short-range attractive interaction modeled by a contact interaction and has attracted much interest across different disciplines. The UFG is considered a paradigm for strongly correlated superfluids and has been investigated extensively, with generally good agreement found between theory and experiment. However, the extent of a pseudogap regime above the critical temperature $T_c$ for superfluidity is still debated both theoretically and experimentally. Here we study thermodynamic properties of the UFG across the superfluid phase transition using finite-temperature lattice auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFMC) methods in the canonical ensemble of fixed particle numbers. We extrapolate our lattice AFMC results to the continuous time and continuum limits, thus removing the systematic error associated with the finite filling factor of previous AFMC studies. We determine the critical temperature to be $T_c=0.16(1)\\, T_{F}$. For the largest particle number studied $N=114$, the energy-staggering pairing gap is suppressed above a pairing scale temperature of $T^{*}\\approx 0.2\\,T_F$. The spin susceptibility displays moderate suppression above $T_c$ with a spin gap temperature of $T_s\\approx 0.2 \\,T_F$. We also calculate a free energy-staggering pairing gap, which shows substantially reduced statistical errors when compared with the energy-staggering gap, allowing for a clear signature of pairing correlations in the finite-size system. All results indicate that the pseudogap regime is narrow, with pseudogap signatures emerging at temperatures below $T^{*}\\approx 0.2 \\, T_F$. The reduced statistical errors of the free energy gap enable an extrapolation at low temperatures, allowing an estimate of the zero-temperature pairing gap $\\Delta_E = 0.576(24) \\, \\epsilon_F$.",

These self-dual classical configurations have topological charge $k/N$ and can be described as a sum over $k$ closely packed lumps in an instanton liquid.

    "abstract": "We apply a stochastic version of the geometric (Ricci) flow, complemented with the stochastic flow of the gauge Yang-Mills sector, in order to seed the chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric vortices that source the area-law for QCD confinement. The area-law is the key signature of quark confinement in Yang-Mills gauge theories with a non-trivial center symmetry. In particular, chromo-magnetic vortices enclosed within the chromo-electric Wilson loops instantiate the area-law asymptotic behaviour of the Wilson loop vacuum expectation values. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow is responsible for the topology changes that induce the appearance of the vortices. When vortices vanish, due to topology changes in the manifolds associated to the hadronic ground states, the evaluation of the Wilson loop yields a dependence on the length of the path, hence reproducing the perimeter law of the hadronic (Higgs) phase of real QCD. Confinement, instead, is naturally achieved within this context as a by-product of the topology change of the manifold over which the dynamics of the Yang-Mills fields is defined. It is then provided by the Aharonov-Bohm effect induced by the concatenation of the compact chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fluxes originated by the topology changes. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow naturally accomplishes a treatment of the emergence of the vortices and the generation of turbulence effects. Braiding and knotting, resulting from topology changes, namely stochastic fluctuations of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system, stabilise the chromo-magnetic vortices and dynamically induce, as non-trivial topological features, chiral symmetry-breaking. The latter is due to the appearance of torsional degrees of freedom, to which four fermion interactions are related, and to the formation of fermion condensates, in which gluon strings get stabilised by non-trivial braiding.",

The study is based on the set of Schwinger-Dyson equations that govern the vertex form factors, derived within the formalism of the three-particle-irreducible (3PI) effective action. The analysis is performed by employing lattice data for the main ingredients, such as gluon and quark propagators, and three-gluon vertex. The numerical treatment is simplified by decoupling the system of integral equations: the classical form factor is determined from a single non-linear equation involving only itself, while the remaining ones are subsequently computed through simple integrations. The form factors are obtained for arbitrary values of space-like momenta, and their angular dependence is examined in detail. A clear hierarchy is established at the level of the corresponding dimensionless effective couplings, in agreement with results of earlier studies. Furthermore, the classical form factor is found to be in excellent agreement with recent unquenched lattice data in the soft-gluon configuration, while the two non-classical dressings depart substantially from the lattice results. Finally, the accurate implementation of multiplicative renormalizability is confirmed, and the transition from Minkoswski to Euclidean space is elucidated.",

The results are based on the same quenched Wilson ensembles on a $24^3\\times 48$ lattice at $\\beta=6.0$ with pion mass from 1100 to 370 MeV previously used for a charged pion. For electric polarizability, the results are largely consistent with those from the background field method and ChPT. In contrast, there are significant differences for magnetic polarizability among the four-point function method, the background field method, and ChPT. The situation points to the potentially important role of disconnected diagrams for a neutral pion. We elucidate a transparent quark decomposition in the four-point function method that can be used to shed light on the issue.",

Our approach extends the scalable circuits ADAPT-VQE framework, which builds an ansatz from a pool of coordinate-invariant operators defined for arbitrarily large, though not arbitrarily small, volumes. Our method uses a classically tractable ``Surrogate Constructed'' method to remove irrelevant operators from the pool, reducing the minimum size for which the scalable circuits are defined. Bringing together the scalable circuits and the surrogate constructed approaches forms the core of the (SC)$^2$ methodology. Our approach allows for a wider set of classical computations, on small volumes, which can be used for a more robust extrapolation protocol. While developed in the context of lattice models, the surrogate construction portion is applicable to a wide variety of problems where information about the relative importance of operators in the pool is available. As an example, we use it to compute properties of the Schwinger model - quantum electrodynamics for a single, massive fermion in $1+1$ dimensions - and show that our method can be used to accurately extrapolate to the continuum limit.",

Having verified the validity of the weak-coupling results in QCD at finite isospin density, we discuss possible effects on QCD at finite baryon density, which is relevant for the application to realistic environments such as neutron stars, by using the fact that QCD at finite baryon and isospin density have the common weak-coupling expansions. First, we show the size of the color-superconducting gap at finite baryon density is as small as a few MeV at $\\mu = 1$ GeV, which implies that the color-flavor locked phase may be unstable against unpairing up to $\\mu \\sim 1.4$ GeV even in the weak-coupling regime.

    "abstract": "The backreaction of a conformal matter sector and its associated conformal anomaly on gravity can be systematically studied using the formalism of the anomaly effective action. This action, defined precisely in flat spacetime within ordinary quantum field theory, can be analyzed perturbatively in terms of external graviton insertions. The expansion coefficients correspond to correlation functions of the stress-energy tensor, which are renormalized through two key counterterms: the square of the Weyl tensor $(C^2)$ and the Gauss-Bonnet term $(E)$. Anomalous conformal Ward identities impose hierarchical constraints on this expansion, revealing that the anomaly's contribution arises from bilinear mixings of the form $R \\Box^{-1} E$ and $R \\Box^{-1} C^2$, supplemented by local Weyl-invariant terms. These mixings reflect the non-local structure of the anomaly. The precise form of the effective action, however, may vary depending on the regularization scheme used, with potential differences manifesting through additional Weyl-invariant terms. These actions encapsulate the breaking of Weyl invariance in the early universe, with implications that are particularly relevant during the inflationary epoch. For chiral and gravitational anomalies, we demonstrate that the corresponding effective actions exhibit similar structures, influencing the evolution of chiral asymmetries in the early universe plasma.",

Our approach combines a relativistic diffusion model with formulations based on quantum chromodynamics while utilizing numerical solutions of a Fokker-Planck equation to account for the shift and broadening of the fragmentation sources for particle-production with respect to the stopping (net-baryon) rapidity distributions. To represent the centrality dependence of charged-hadron production in asymmetric systems over a broad region of pseudorapidities, the consideration and precise modelling of the fragmentation sources - along with the central gluon-gluon source - is found to be essential.

    "abstract": "We consider ultralight scalar dark matter that couples to right-handed neutrinos. Due to the high density of neutrinos in the early universe, the background neutrino density dominates the dynamics of the scalar field, and qualitatively alters the field's cosmological evolution. This effect has not been included in previous literature, and changes the interpretation of cosmological data and its interplay with laboratory experiments. To illustrate these points a simplified model of a $1+1$ setup with a single scalar field is analyzed.   We find that: {\\it i}) The scalar field experiences an asymmetric potential and its energy density redshifts differently than ordinary matter. {\\it ii}) Neutrino mass measurements at the CMB and oscillation experiments performed today complement one another (i.e., they constrain different regions of parameter space). {\\it iii}) There exists potentially interesting cosmologies with either $O(1)$ variations in the dark matter density between the CMB and today, or $O(1)$ oscillations of neutrino mass.",

    "abstract": "In dense neutrino environments, such as provided by core-collapse supernovae or neutron-star mergers, neutrino angular distributions may be unstable to collective flavor conversions, whose outcome remains to be fully understood. These conversions are much faster than hydrodynamical scales, suggesting that self-consistent configurations may never be strongly unstable. With this motivation in mind, we study weakly unstable modes, i.e., those with small growth rates. We show that our newly developed dispersion relation (Paper~I of this series) allows for an expansion in powers of the small growth rate. For weakly unstable distributions, we show that the unstable modes must either move with subluminal phase velocity, or very close to the speed of light. The instability is fed from neutrinos moving resonantly with the waves, allowing us to derive explicit expressions for the growth rate. For axisymmetric distributions, often assumed in the literature, numerical examples show the accuracy of these expressions. We also note that for the often-studied one-dimensional systems one should not forget the axial-symmetry-breaking modes, and we provide explicit expressions for the range of wavenumbers that exhibit instabilities.",

However, these two requirements make the determination of PDFs from lattice data very challenging. We present the application of generative machine learning algorithms to estimate the polarized and unpolarized gluon correlation functions utilizing short-distance data and extending the correlation up to $zp_z \\lesssim 14$, surpassing the current capabilities of lattice QCD calculations. We train physics-informed machine learning algorithms to learn from the short-distance correlation at $z\\lesssim 0.36$ fm and take the limit, $p_z \\to \\infty$, thereby minimizing possible contamination from the higher-twist effects for a successful reconstruction of the polarized gluon PDF.

We explore two possible cases for the evolution of dark particles among hidden sectors: (1) The WIMP annihilates efficiently and achieves the observed relic density with the assistance of the concealed sector. (2) The WIMP transforms into another type of dark matter within the concealed sector and attains the observed relic density. Annihilating to the darker explains why WIMPs have remained undetected, and all WIMP models will continue to hold interest.",

    "abstract": "There have long been questions about the limits to the validity of relativistic fluid dynamics, and whether it is being used outside its regime of validity in modern simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. An important new tool for answering this question is a causality analysis in the nonlinear regime -- if the solutions of the evolution equations do not respect relativistic causality, they are not a faithful representation of the underlying relativistic theory (in this case, quantum chromodynamics). Using this non-linear criterion, it has recently been shown that hydrodynamics is indeed being used outside its regime of validity in simulations, at least sometimes. Here we explore the phenomenological implications, particularly the quantitative effects of demanding limits on acausality in modern Bayesian parameter estimation. We find that, while typically only a small fraction of the system's energy is initially in an acausal regime, placing strict limits on the allowed energy fraction significantly changes the preferred properties of the initial condition, which in turn alters the extracted medium properties such as bulk viscosity, where large values are no longer favored. These findings highlight the importance of developing better theoretical descriptions of the early-time, out-of-equilibrium dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.",

In this work, I test whether, and to what extent, this preference is supported by CMB experiments other than Planck. I analyze the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South Pole Telescope (SPT) temperature, polarization, and lensing spectra at small scales, eventually combining them with Planck or WMAP 9-year observations at large angular scales. My analysis shows that ACT and WMAP data, when combined with DESI BAO and Pantheon-plus Supernovae, yield independent constraints with a precision comparable to Planck. Notably, in this case, the cosmological constant value is recovered within two standard deviations. A preference for DDE reappears when Pantheon-plus is replaced with distance moduli measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DESy5). However, it remains less pronounced compared to the Planck-based results. When considering SPT data, no clear preference for DDE is found, although the parameter uncertainties are significantly larger compared to both Planck- and ACT-based constraints. Overall, CMB experiments other than Planck generally weaken the evidence for DDE. I argue that the subsets of Planck data that strengthen the shift toward DDE are the temperature and E-mode polarization anisotropy measurements at large angular scales $\\ell \\lesssim 30$.",

The one-loop vacuum-polarization effect is by far the dominant quantum electrodynamic (QED) energy correction for bound muons, being of order $\\alpha (Z\\alpha)^2 m_r$, where $\\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant, $Z$ is the nuclear charge number, and $m_r$ is the reduced mass. Gauge invariance of the relativistic and recoil corrections to vacuum polarization of order $\\alpha (Z\\alpha)^4 m_r$ is investigated with respect to nonretarded and standard, renormalized variants of Coulomb gauge. The invariance is shown after including three-photon exchange diagrams. Our derivation is based on an adapted form of Nonrelativistic Quantum Electrodynamics for bound muon systems (NRQED$_\\mu$), which is a version of NRQED where the hard scale is set at the muon mass instead of the electron mass.

The calculation of cross sections, the optical theorem and Boltzmann $H$-theorem from unitarity of the $S$ matrix are also explained. Special emphasis is given to expansions in partial-wave amplitudes of two-body scattering amplitudes, both for massive and massless particles, and to unitarity in partial-wave amplitudes.

    "title": "Neutron Star with Dark Matter Admixture: A Candidate for Bridging the Mass Gap",
    "abstract": "Neutron stars and black holes are the after death remnants of massive stars. However, according to the most recent observations, the neutron stars maximum mass is between $2.0-2.5 M_{\\odot}$ while black holes of less than 5 $M_{\\odot}$ rarely has been observed. The region between the most massive neutron star and the least massive black hole is called the mass gap. If indeed its existence is confirmed by future observations, that indicates a gap in our understanding which seeks for explanation. In addition, the existence of compact objects within the mass gap should also be supported with the help of possible new theoretical scenarios. In this letter, we propose a possible explanation for the existence of compact objects within the mass gap region. Specifically, we propose that the mass gap region could be bridged by the existence of a hybrid compact object, composed of hadronic and self interacting - non annihilating fermionic dark matter, considering that the interaction between these two fluids its only gravitational. Fundamental questions about how these objects form and how they can be detected are also addressed.",

Owing to its large production cross section at the LHC, this process is very useful for SM precision studies, electroweak symmetry breaking sector as well as to unravel the possible new physics. In this work, we have performed the threshold resummation of the large logarithms that arise in the partonic threshold limit $z \\to 1$, up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy. The presence of the two-loop contributions in the process dependent resummation coefficient $g_0$ makes the numerical computation a non-trivial task. After matching the resummed predictions to the Next-to-Next-to-Leading order (NNLO) fixed order results, we present the invariant mass distribution to NNLO+NNLL accuracy in QCD for the current LHC energies. We find that in the high invariant mass region ($Q=1$ TeV), while the NNLO corrections are as large as $83\\%$ with respect to the leading order, the NNLL contribution enhances the cross section by additional few percent, about $4\\%$ for $13.6$ TeV LHC. In this invariant mass region, the conventional scale uncertainties in the fixed order results get reduced from $3.4\\%$ at NNLO to about $2.6\\%$ at NNLO+NNLL, and this reduction is expected to be more for higher $Q$ values.",

We leverage on the approaching detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) to explore whether, if the DSNB showed departures from theoretical predictions, we could attribute such modifications to new physics unequivocally. In order to do so, we focus on visible neutrino decay. Many of the signatures from neutrino decay are degenerate with astrophysical unknowns entering the DSNB modeling. Next generation neutrino observatories, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, JUNO, as well as DUNE, will set stringent limits on a neutrino lifetime over mass ratio $\\tau/m \\sim 10^{9}$-$10^{10}$ s eV$^{-1}$ at $90\\%$ C.L., if astrophysical uncertainties and detector backgrounds were to be fully under control. However, if the lightest neutrino is almost massless and the neutrino mass ordering is normal, constraining visible decay will not be realistically possible in the coming few decades. We also assess the challenges of distinguishing among different new physics scenarios (such as visible decay, invisible decay, and quasi-Dirac neutrinos), all leading up to similar signatures in the DSNB. This work shows that the DSNB potential for probing new physics strongly depends on an improved understanding of the experimental backgrounds at next generation neutrino observatories as well as progress in the DSNB modeling.",

We focus on $S_4$, one of the most commonly used groups in lepton flavour mixing models. The spontaneous breaking of $S_4$ leads to distinct vacua preserving a residual $Z_2$ or $Z_3$ symmetry. Five types of domain walls are found, labelled as SI, SII, TI, TII, and TIII, respectively, the former two separating $Z_2$ vacua and the latter three separating $Z_3$ vacua. We highlight that SI, TI and TIII may be unstable for some regions of the parameter space and decay to stable domain walls. Stable domain walls can collapse and release gravitational radiation for a suitable size of explicit symmetry breaking. A symmetry-breaking scale of order 100 TeV may explain the recent discovery of nanohertz gravitational waves by PTA experiments. For the first time, we investigate the properties of these domain walls, which we obtain numerically with semi-analytical formulas applied to compute the tension and thickness across a wide range of parameter space. We estimate the resulting gravitational wave spectrum and find that, thanks to their rich vacuum structure, non-Abelian domain walls manifest in a very interesting and complex phenomenology.",

    "abstract": "With the highly anticipated results from the Beam Energy Scan II program at RHIC being recently revealed, an understanding of particle-number fluctuations and their significance as a potential signature of a possible QCD critical point is crucial. Early works that embarked on this endeavor sought to estimate the fluctuations due to the presence of a critical point assuming they stay in equilibrium. From these results came the proposal to focus efforts on higher, non-Gaussian, moments of the event-by-event distributions, in particular of the number of protons. These non-Gaussian moments are especially sensitive to critical fluctuations, as their magnitudes are proportional to high powers of the critical correlation length. As the equation of state provides key input for hydrodynamical simulations of heavy-ion collisions, we estimate equilibrium fluctuations from the BEST equation of state (EoS) that includes critical features from the 3D Ising Model. In particular, the proton factorial cumulants and their dependence on non-universal mapping parameters is investigated within the BEST EoS. Furthermore, the correlation length, as a central quantity for the assessment of fluctuations in the vicinity of a critical point, is also calculated in a consistent manner with the scaling equation of state. An understanding of the equilibrium estimates of proton factorial cumulants will be useful for further comparison to estimates of out-of-equilibrium fluctuations in order to determine the magnitude of the observable fluctuations to be expected in heavy-ion collision experiments, in which the time spent near a critical point is short.",

The mirror Standard Model sector particles can form mirror atoms and hadrons and all these stable particles can comprise a large part of the dark matter of the Universe. These mirror Standard Model particles acquire mass through a low-temperature dark first order phase transition. We examine in detail this dark phase transition and we indicate how stochastic gravitational waves can be generated through this transition. Such a phase transition can generate stochastic gravitational waves that can be detected by the future gravitational wave experiments. For the model we use, the produced energy spectrum of the gravitational waves can be detected by the SKA. Moreover, we propose a possible way to detect effects of the particle nature of dark matter, using observational data coming from the guitar nebula. We assume that the guitar nebula bow shock is generated by the interaction of the high speed neutron star that passes through the interstellar medium, which is assumed to be comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen. Our main proposal is that the opening angle of the bow shock can be directly related to the speed of sound of the dark matter particles, and a large angle of the bow shock could be a strong indicator that the interstellar medium is comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen gas. This is motivated by the Bosma effect which indicates that hydrogen is always in correlation with dark matter, and hydrogen gas is strongly present in the guitar nebula.",

    "abstract": "In collisions between heavy nuclei, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, hydrodynamic models have successfully related measured azimuthal momentum anisotropies to the transverse shape of the collision region. For an elliptically shaped interaction area, the hydrodynamic pressure gradient is greater along the minor axis, resulting in increased particle momentum in that direction - a phenomenon known as positive elliptic flow. In this paper, we demonstrate that in smaller systems, such as proton-proton and peripheral ion-ion collisions, microscopic models for final state interactions, can produce anisotropies where the elliptic flow is negative - that is, the momentum is largest along the major axis, contrary to hydrodynamic predictions. We present results from two distinct microscopic models: one based on repulsion between string-like fields and another based on effective kinetic theory. Negative elliptic flow is a solid prediction of the string interaction model while in the model based on kinetic theory it is linked to a finite interaction range. Consequently, an experimental determination of the sign of elliptic flow, will provide novel insights into the degrees of freedom governing strong nuclear interactions in high-energy collisions and the way in which they interact.",

    "abstract": "We study the decay of a homogeneous condensate of a massive scalar field of mass \\emph{m} into massless fields in thermal equilibrium in a radiation dominated cosmology. The model is a \\emph{proxy} for the non-equilibrium dynamics of a misaligned axion condensate decaying into radiation. After consistent field quantization in the cosmological background, we obtain the causal equations of motion for a homogeneous condensate including the finite temperature self-energy corrections up to one loop. The dynamical renormalization group is implemented to obtain the time dependent relaxation rate that describes the decay dynamics of the condensate amplitude from stimulated emission and recombination of massless quanta in the medium. It is explicitly shown that a simple friction term in the equation of motion does not describe correctly the decay of the condensate. During the super-Hubble regime, relevant for ultralight dark matter, the condensate amplitude decays as $e^{-\\frac{g^2}{10} t^2\\,\\ln(1/mt)}$. In the sub-Hubble regime the amplitude decays as $e^{-\\gamma(t;T(t))/2}$ with $T(t)=T_0/a(t)$, therefore the finite temperature contribution to the decay rate vanishes fast during the expansion. A main conclusion is that a phenomenological friction term is inadequate to describe the decay in the super-Hubble regime, the decay function $\\gamma(t)$ is always \\emph{smaller} than that from a local friction term as a consequence of the cosmological expansion. For ultra light dark matter, the time scale during which transient dynamics is sensitive to cosmological expansion and a local friction term is inadequate, is much longer. A friction term always \\emph{underestimates} the time scale of decay in the sub-Hubble case.",

We assume that the LQ decays into a top quark and a muon. The collider analysis for an LQ decaying into a top quark is distinct from that of lighter quarks. A TeV-scale LQ decaying into a top quark can produce an exotic, boosted fat-jet signature. In addition to the usual searches based on pair production of LQs, we also examine the single production mode, which depends on the $S_1 t \\mu$ coupling. We demonstrate that systematically combining the pair and single production modes significantly enhances the discovery potential of the LQ at the muon collider. Our signal topology includes at least one hadronically decaying top fat-jet and two oppositely charged muons, thereby enabling the incorporation of the single production mode.

In contrast to other explanations based on boson stars, our SS+MDM model offers a natural explanation for this system.

    "abstract": "The ground state of moderately dense cold quark matter is investigated within the framework of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. It is found that in the regime of weak and intermediate diquark coupling strength, the color-spin-locked (CSL) phase could be most favored, and the density range where CSL phase survives is determined by two quark chemical potentials: one corresponding to the chiral phase transition and the other for the emergence of the gapless color-flavor-locked (CFL) condensate. Based on the theoretical hypothesis that the quark star could be the hideout for CSL quark matter, an interesting scenario is proposed that the phase transition to the CSL phase could occur in the cooling process of a proper quark star. The CSL quark matter is an electromagnetic superconductor of Type-I, and a complete Meissner effect is expected. However, the analysis for this sizable superconductor indicates that most of the magnetic field is frozen inside the star with a critical strength, while in some special cases, a small fraction could be expelled from a thin layer near the surface in a short time. An analysis on energetics and time scale is performed to investigate if this expulsion of magnetic flux could power or induce high-energy electromagnetic emissions.",

We study the linear stability of those hairy BHs by considering even-parity perturbations in the eikonal limit. In the angular direction, we show that one of the three dynamical perturbations has a nontrivial squared propagation speed $c_{\\Omega,1}^2$, while the other two dynamical modes are luminal. We could detect two different unstable behaviors of perturbations in all the parameter spaces of hairy asymptotically flat BH solutions we searched for.

For the second case, it is possible to avoid this horizon instability, but in such cases, the positivity of $c_{\\Omega,1}^2$ is violated at large distances. Hence these hairy BHs are generally prone to Laplacian instabilities along the angular direction in some regions outside the horizon. Moreover, we also encounter a pathological behavior of the radial propagation speeds $c_r$ possessing two different values of $c_r^2$ for one of the dynamical perturbations. Introducing the vector-field mass $m$ to cubic vector Galileons, however, we show that the resulting no-hair Schwarzschild BH solution satisfies all the linear stability conditions in the small-scale limit, with luminal propagation speeds of three dynamical even-parity perturbations.",

Further, using this potential to model mass spectra of charmonium and bottomonium, we show that results for the calculated quark mass spectra align closely with experimentally observed values, reflecting the veracity and accuracy of the approach. This close correspondence between calculated and experimental spectra highlights this potential model's efficacy in describing heavy quarkonium systems. The insights gained from this study reinforce the applicability of this potential model in quantum mechanics and particle physics and lay a foundation for its extension to other quantum systems, suggesting a feasible avenue for future research.",

    "abstract": "The tension between direct measurements of the Hubble constant and those stemming from Cosmic Microwave Background probes has triggered a multitude of studies. The connection between cosmology and particle physics has shown to be a valuable approach to addressing the Hubble tension. In particular, increasing the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early universe helps alleviate the problem. In this work, we write down effective field theory describing relativistic dark matter production in association with neutrinos leading to a larger $H_0$. We derive limits on the effective energy scale that governs this relativistic production of dark matter as a function of the dark matter mass for fermion, vector, and scalar dark matter fields. In particular, scalar dark matter particles are more effective in increasing the effective number of relativistic species. Also, if they have weak scale masses, then the relativistic production of dark matter should be governed by Planck scale effective operators in order to alleviate the Hubble tension.",

We find P violation leads to a preference for particular spin combinations and has significant effects on QE and the extent of BI violation. Within the quantum field theory (QFT) framework, for spin-0 particles decaying into two fermions, parameters for the concurrence and the BI for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt case are found to be $\\sqrt{1 - \\alpha^2}$ and $2 \\sqrt{2 - \\alpha^2}$, respectively, where $-1\\leq \\alpha\\ \\leq 1$ quantifies the size of P violation. For spin-1 particle decays, we find that P-violating interactions introduce effects similar to those in the spin-0 case. Without knowledge from the QFT, for the spin-0 case, the general form of density matrices requires measuring only one parameter for P-conserving decays and three otherwise. For spin-1 cases, there would be nine parameters in general. We further study the overlooked effect on QE and BI induced by the magnetic field in detectors and find it essential for a genuine test of P and CP symmetries.",

The photon spectrum emitted by such an electron wave packet in the presence of a linearly-polarized plane wave is studied both analytically and numerically. The spectrum is also compared with the one emitted by a single-momentum, plane-wave electron in the case of the electron being initially counter-propagating (on average for the flying-focus case) with the plane wave and within the locally-constant field approximation. It is found that if the electron flying-focus wave packet is focused beyond a Compton wavelength, the angular distribution of the emitted radiation along the magnetic field of the electromagnetic plane wave is broader than for an electron with definite momentum.

To remove the undesirable flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNCs), an additional $\\mathcal Z_2$ symmetry is usually imposed into the 2HDM. However, FCNCs can be avoided in a much more general way by assuming a similar Yukawa structure for the two scalar doublets. But one can circumvent the issue of FCNCs by assuming similar Yukawa structure for the two scalar doublets too. The model with this intriguing feature is termed the Aligned Two Higgs Doublet Model (A2HDM). The phenomenological constraints on the A2HDM are much weaker than the ones on the usual $\\mathcal Z_2$ models, opening a broader range of possible scenarios. Moreover, the A2HDM also provides a generic framework to study, as particular cases, the different varieties of $\\mathcal Z_2$-symmetric 2HDMs. Here, we illustrate a global fit of the A2HDM using the package HEPfit. We study the possibility of having new scalar particles lighter than the SM Higgs.

Because the precise data for $V_{ud}$ is usually extracted from super-allowed nuclear $\\beta$ decay, it is quite significant to investigate the breaking of SU(3) flavor symmetry on the weak vector coupling constant in nuclear matter. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the isoscalar scalar ($\\sigma$) and the isovector scalar ($\\delta$ or $a_0$) mean-fields affect the weak vector and axial-vector coupling constants for semileptonic baryon (neutron, $\\Lambda$ or $\\Xi^-$) decay in asymmetric nuclear matter. To do so, we use the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, where nuclear matter consists of nucleons including quark degrees of freedom bound by the self-consistent exchange of scalar and vector mesons. We pay careful attention to the center of mass correction to the quark currents in matter. We then find that, for neutron $\\beta$ decay in asymmetric nuclear matter, the defect of the vector coupling constant due to the $\\delta$ field can be of the order of $10^{-4}$ at the nuclear saturation density, which is the same amount as the level of the current uncertainty in the measurements. It is also interesting that, in neutron-rich matter, there exists a certain low density at which isospin symmetry is restored, that is, the $u$-$d$ quark mass difference vanishes. We conclude that the effect of the isoscalar scalar and the isovector scalar fields should be considered in baryon semileptonic decays in nuclei.",

    "abstract": "The high-temperature limit of the superconformal index, especially on higher sheets, often captures useful universal information about a theory. In 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories with fractional r-charges, there exists a special notion of high-temperature limit on higher sheets that captures data of three-dimensional topological quantum field theories arising from r-twisted circle reduction. These TQFTs are closely tied with the VOA of the 4d SCFT. We study such high-temperature limits. More specifically, we apply Di~Pietro-Komargodski type supersymmetric effective field theory techniques to r-twisted circle reductions of $(A_1,A_{2n})$ Argyres-Douglas theories, leveraging their Maruyoshi-Song Lagrangian with manifest $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. The result on the second sheet is the Gang-Kim-Stubbs family of 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY enhancing rank-$0$ theories with monopole superpotentials, whose boundary supports the Virasoro minimal model VOAs $M(2,2n+3)$. Upon topological twist, they give non-unitary TQFTs controlled by the $M(2,2n+3)$ modular tensor category (MTC). The high-temperature limit on other sheets yields their unitary or non-unitary Galois conjugates. This opens up the prospect of a broader four-supercharge perspective on the celebrated correspondence between 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs and 2d VOAs via interpolating 3d EFTs. Several byproducts follow, including a systematic approach to 3d SUSY enhancement from 4d SUSY enhancement, and a 3d QFT handle on Galois orbits of various MTCs associated with 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs.",

In this paper, we investigate the consequences of projective algebras formed by non-invertible symmetries and lattice translations in a generalized $1+1$D quantum XY model based on group-valued qudits. This model is specified by a finite group $G$ and enjoys a projective $\\mathsf{Rep}(G)\\times Z(G)$ and translation symmetry, where symmetry operators obey a projective algebra in the presence of symmetry defects. For invertible symmetries, such projective algebras imply Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies. However, this is not generally true for non-invertible symmetries, and we derive a condition on $G$ for the existence of an LSM anomaly. When this condition is not met, we prove that any unique and gapped ground state is necessarily a non-invertible weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) state with non-trivial entanglement, for which we construct an example fixed-point Hamiltonian. The projectivity also affects the dual symmetries after gauging $\\mathsf{Rep}(G)\\times Z(G)$ sub-symmetries, giving rise to non-Abelian and non-invertible dipole symmetries, as well as non-invertible translations. We complement our analysis with the SymTFT, where the projectivity causes it to be a topological order non-trivially enriched by translations.

This action, defined precisely in flat spacetime within ordinary quantum field theory, can be analyzed perturbatively in terms of external graviton insertions. The expansion coefficients correspond to correlation functions of the stress-energy tensor, which are renormalized through two key counterterms: the square of the Weyl tensor $(C^2)$ and the Gauss-Bonnet term $(E)$. Anomalous conformal Ward identities impose hierarchical constraints on this expansion, revealing that the anomaly's contribution arises from bilinear mixings of the form $R \\Box^{-1} E$ and $R \\Box^{-1} C^2$, supplemented by local Weyl-invariant terms. These mixings reflect the non-local structure of the anomaly. The precise form of the effective action, however, may vary depending on the regularization scheme used, with potential differences manifesting through additional Weyl-invariant terms. These actions encapsulate the breaking of Weyl invariance in the early universe, with implications that are particularly relevant during the inflationary epoch.

The latter has been considered an extension of the worldline effective field theory. We show that the eikonal and WQFT methods are equivalent and that calculations can be translated freely between them.   Concretely, we focus on 2-into-2 scattering processes mediated by massless force carriers. On the one hand, taking the classical limit of the QFT scattering amplitude leads to the eikonal method. On the other hand, since in the classical limit the scattering particles are almost on-shell throughout the scattering process, the worldline, a first quantized formalism, is the most efficient framework to study the scattering amplitude. This is an alternate but equivalent formalism to the quantum field theoretic (QFT) framework. By taking the classical limit of the scattering amplitude computed in the worldline, we can derive the WQFT rules of Mogull, Plefka and Steinhoff. In WQFT, the Feynman diagrams are reorganized into a new set of diagrams that facilitate the $\\hbar$ expansion. Unlike the QFT eikonal method, which works recursively in identifying the eikonal phase, the worldline-based computation allows to target and systematically extract the classical contributions directly through a specific set of WQFT diagrams. In worldline formalism the perturbative expansion of the scattering amplitude is naturally organized in diagrams which factorize (reducible) and diagrams which are new to that order (irreducible), in a one-to-one map with the structure of the amplitude in the eikonal method.

Since this alternate formulation can be directly applied to the real-time quantum theory, it is insensitive to subtleties involved in defining the Euclidean path integral. In particular, it can be consistent with many different choices of integration contour.   Despite the fact that self-adjoint operators in the associated real-time quantum theory have real eigenvalues, we note that the bulk wavefunction encodes the Euclidean (or complex) R\\'enyi geometries that would arise in any Euclidean path integral. As a result, for any given quantum state, the appropriate real-time path integral yields both R\\'enyi entropies and associated complex saddle-point geometries that agree with Euclidean methods.

    "abstract": "In this work, we analyze various phenomena influenced by the gravitational field in a bumblebee gravity solution, with a particular emphasis on a traversable wormhole for massless particle modes. Specifically, we calculate the index of refraction, group velocity, time delay, modified distances, and interparticle potential, demonstrating the possibility of photon-photon interactions due to the wormhole geometry. For the latter aspect, we also extend the analysis to massive particle modes, resulting in a ``combination'' of modified Yukawa- and Couloumb-like potentials. These calculations are shown to be dependent on the wormhole's parameters, particularly the wormhole throat. Finally, we derive thermodynamic properties for photon-like modes by considering the modified dispersion relation induced by the wormhole geometry, taking into account non-interacting particle modes. Remarkably, all calculations are performed in an analytical manner.",

In particular, we show numerically that the entanglement entropy curves in this disordered phase follow the expected scaling of a conformal field theory (CFT) in the continuum limit. This property is shown to be non-generic for other types of quasiperiodic disorder, only appearing when our boundary disorder ansatz is described by a \"dual\" bulk hyperbolic tiling.

Minimal triway cuts can be formulated as integer programs which cannot be relaxed to find a dual maximal flow/bit-thread description. This sheds light on the gap between the existence of tripartite entanglement in holographic states and the bipartite entanglement structure motivated by bit-threads.

Particles on these orbits extract energy from the BH through their radiation field; the net effect is an increase in the particles' kinetic energy, so that they outspiral to infinity.

On the other hand, non-invertible duality defects have attracted substantial attention in communities of high energy and condensed matter physics due to their deep insight into quantum anomalies and exotic phases of matter. However, the connection between these exotic symmetries and defects has not been fully explored. In this paper, we construct concrete lattice models with non-invertible duality defects via gauging spatially modulated symmetries and investigate their exotic fusion rules. Specifically, we construct spin models with subsystem symmetries or dipole symmetries on one, two, and three-dimensional lattices. Gauging subsystem symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects whose fusion rules involve $0$-form subsystem charges in two dimensions and higher-form operators that correspond to ``lineon'' excitations (excitations which are mobile along one-dimensional line) in three dimensions. Gauging dipole symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects with dipole algebras that describe a hierarchical structure between global and dipole charges. Notably, the hierarchical structure of the dual dipole charges is inverted compared with the original ones.

It can be argued that these phenomena happen in the final stages of evaporation, where the semiclassical approximation needs to be refined with quantum corrections also for the gravitational interaction. A natural way to describe gravity at high energies is to add quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action, i.e. quadratic gravity. At the cosmological level it is known that its classical solutions can give rise to a model of inflation that matches observations strikingly well, while in an astrophysical context it allows for the possibility of non-Schwarzschild black holes at small masses. These solutions have very peculiar properties, due to the presence of a massive spin-2 particle corresponding to a ghost at the quantum level. The branch of non-Schwarzschild solutions crosses the one of Schwarzschild ones at a specific mass which could be between the one of an asteroid and the Planck mass, depending on the value of a slightly constrained free parameter. By analyzing their dynamical stability and thermodynamical properties, we investigate what could happen to a black hole that has evaporated to this crossing point.

An example is the negativity of tripartite information. Inspired by this, we investigate the analogous entropy inequalities in Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and sparse SYK models, which involve the entanglement among different flavors of Majorana fermions rather than spatial entanglement. Sparse SYK models are models where some of the SYK couplings are set to zero. Since these models have been argued to admit gravity duals up to a certain sparseness, it is interesting to see whether the multipartite entanglement structure changes in a sparseness-dependent manner. In the parameter space explored by our numerical analysis, which we performed upto five parties, we find that all entropy inequalities are satisfied for any temperature and degree of sparseness for an arbitrary choice of flavor subregions. In addition, if we plot the multipartite entanglement entropy in terms of purity, the only significant effect of sparseness is to change the range of purity. Thus, we conclude that multipartite information is almost unaffected by sparseness. As a counterexample, we also show that in a vector model of $N$-flavored Majorana fermions which contains no random variables, choices of subregions exist for which the entropy inequalities are violated.",

All possible minimal transitions are given, identifying differences between slices that emerge on the Higgs and Coulomb branches. In particular, the algorithm is sensitive to global information including monodromies and Namikawa-Weyl groups. Guided by symplectic duality, the algorithm further determines the global symmetry on the Coulomb branch, and verifies the exclusion of $C$ type or $F_4$ global symmetry for (simply-laced) unitary quiver gauge theories. The Higgs branches of some unitary quivers are verified to give slices in the nilpotent cones of exceptional simple Lie algebras.",

Their equivariantisations describe representation categories of fixed-point vertex operator algebras, also called orbifolds. The seminal work of Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik asserts the existence and uniqueness of the $G$-crossed extensions we construct.   In particular, for the group $G=\\mathbb{Z}_2$ acting as inversion on a discriminant form or metric group, we explicitly construct a braided $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-crossed tensor category with a nondegenerate braiding that generalises the Tambara-Yamagami category, now with more than one simple object in the twisted sector. Its equivariantisation yields the modular tensor category of the orbifold of a lattice vertex operator algebra under a lift of $-\\mathrm{id}$.   In order to derive the above result, we show that $G$-crossed extensions and condensations by commutative algebras commute appropriately, leading to an effective method for constructing new $G$-crossed extensions.

Hitherto, these quantum effects were analyzed by separating the geometry into the near-horizon region and its exterior. It is desirable to understand and reproduce such corrections from the full higher-dimensional asymptotically flat or AdS geometry's perspective. We address this question in this article and fill this gap. Specifically, we find off-shell eigenmodes of the quadratic fluctuation operator of the Euclidean gravitational dynamics, with eigenvalues that vanish linearly with temperature. We illustrate this for BTZ and neutral black holes with hyperbolic horizons in AdS in Einstein-Hilbert theory, and for the charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory. The linear scaling with Matsubara frequency, which is a distinctive feature of the modes, together with the fact that their wavefunctions localize close to the horizon as we approach extremality, identifies them as responsible for the aforementioned quantum effects. We provide a contour prescription to deal with the sign indefiniteness of the Euclidean Einstein-Maxwell action, which we derive to aid our analysis. We also resolve a technical puzzle regarding modes associated with rotational isometries in stationary black hole spacetimes.",

    "abstract": "What if the dark matter Sector is truly dark, self-interacting and unreachable by terrestrial experiments? How could we find hints of such dark sector if it is experimentally unreachable by any terrestrial experiment? In this work we study a low-mass-scale mirror Standard Model which can act as a model for dark matter, which interacts only gravitationally with the Standard Model particles. The mirror Standard Model sector particles can form mirror atoms and hadrons and all these stable particles can comprise a large part of the dark matter of the Universe. These mirror Standard Model particles acquire mass through a low-temperature dark first order phase transition. We examine in detail this dark phase transition and we indicate how stochastic gravitational waves can be generated through this transition. Such a phase transition can generate stochastic gravitational waves that can be detected by the future gravitational wave experiments. For the model we use, the produced energy spectrum of the gravitational waves can be detected by the SKA. Moreover, we propose a possible way to detect effects of the particle nature of dark matter, using observational data coming from the guitar nebula. We assume that the guitar nebula bow shock is generated by the interaction of the high speed neutron star that passes through the interstellar medium, which is assumed to be comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen. Our main proposal is that the opening angle of the bow shock can be directly related to the speed of sound of the dark matter particles, and a large angle of the bow shock could be a strong indicator that the interstellar medium is comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen gas. This is motivated by the Bosma effect which indicates that hydrogen is always in correlation with dark matter, and hydrogen gas is strongly present in the guitar nebula.",

The model is a \\emph{proxy} for the non-equilibrium dynamics of a misaligned axion condensate decaying into radiation. After consistent field quantization in the cosmological background, we obtain the causal equations of motion for a homogeneous condensate including the finite temperature self-energy corrections up to one loop. The dynamical renormalization group is implemented to obtain the time dependent relaxation rate that describes the decay dynamics of the condensate amplitude from stimulated emission and recombination of massless quanta in the medium. It is explicitly shown that a simple friction term in the equation of motion does not describe correctly the decay of the condensate. During the super-Hubble regime, relevant for ultralight dark matter, the condensate amplitude decays as $e^{-\\frac{g^2}{10} t^2\\,\\ln(1/mt)}$. In the sub-Hubble regime the amplitude decays as $e^{-\\gamma(t;T(t))/2}$ with $T(t)=T_0/a(t)$, therefore the finite temperature contribution to the decay rate vanishes fast during the expansion. A main conclusion is that a phenomenological friction term is inadequate to describe the decay in the super-Hubble regime, the decay function $\\gamma(t)$ is always \\emph{smaller} than that from a local friction term as a consequence of the cosmological expansion. For ultra light dark matter, the time scale during which transient dynamics is sensitive to cosmological expansion and a local friction term is inadequate, is much longer.

This is seemingly at odds with the goal of effective field theory which is to encode ultraviolet corrections in terms of existing low energy degrees of freedom. Here we apply an action-based procedure for the removal of spurious degrees of freedom for the case of general relativity supplemented by a term cubic in the Riemann tensor. To the order we work in, the resulting reduced theory takes the form of minimally modified gravity, which is a class of modified gravity theories that propagate just the massless spin-2 graviton, but exhibit a preferred frame at short distances due to a deformation of time diffeomorphisms. Our work suggests that this class of theories can be understood as an effective theory of gravity, capturing effects of unknown ultraviolet physics.",

The plaquette interaction appears naturally as a ring-exchange term in the low-energy description of exciton Bose liquids, cold atomic gases, and quantum dimer models. Using first-principle Monte Carlo simulations, we study the phase diagram and the vortex dynamics in the XY-plaquette model on a square lattice in two spatial dimensions. In its minimal formulation, the model contains a ring-exchange plaquette term in two spatial dimensions and a standard XY-link term in the (imaginary) time direction. We show that the phase diagram of the minimal XY-plaquette model possesses two phases: (i) a disordered vortex-dominated phase in which a single percolating vortex trajectory occupies the whole 3d spacetime; (ii) a partially disordered phase in which the vortices become partially immobile, with their worldlines strictly confined to one or several infinite two-dimensional planes. The spatial positions and spatial orientations (along $x$ or $y$ axis) of these vortex domain walls appear to be spontaneous. Individual vortices form a disordered system within each vortex domain wall, so the fractal spacetime dimension of vortex trajectories approaches $D_f = 2$. We argue that the appearance of the vortex walls could be interpreted as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of a global internal symmetry in the compact XY-plaquette model.",

Such hairy BHs are present for a vanishing vector-field mass ($m=0$) with a non-zero cubic Galileon coupling $\\beta_3$. We study the linear stability of those hairy BHs by considering even-parity perturbations in the eikonal limit. In the angular direction, we show that one of the three dynamical perturbations has a nontrivial squared propagation speed $c_{\\Omega,1}^2$, while the other two dynamical modes are luminal. We could detect two different unstable behaviors of perturbations in all the parameter spaces of hairy asymptotically flat BH solutions we searched for. In the first case, an angular Laplacian instability on the horizon is induced by negative $c_{\\Omega,1}^2$. For the second case, it is possible to avoid this horizon instability, but in such cases, the positivity of $c_{\\Omega,1}^2$ is violated at large distances. Hence these hairy BHs are generally prone to Laplacian instabilities along the angular direction in some regions outside the horizon. Moreover, we also encounter a pathological behavior of the radial propagation speeds $c_r$ possessing two different values of $c_r^2$ for one of the dynamical perturbations. Introducing the vector-field mass $m$ to cubic vector Galileons, however, we show that the resulting no-hair Schwarzschild BH solution satisfies all the linear stability conditions in the small-scale limit, with luminal propagation speeds of three dynamical even-parity perturbations.",

The dissipation is assumed to arise due to adiabatic gravitational particle creation. For the thermodynamic study, we consider the Bekenstein-Hawking formalism and also assume a nonzero curvature $\\kappa$ for a general study. In particular, we study the unified first law, the generalized second law, and thermodynamic stability in our model. The specific heat capacities are taken into account for the study of thermodynamic stability. Our study reveals a fascinating result! The ratio of the specific heat capacity at constant pressure and that at constant volume in a flat FLRW universe with dissipation is nothing but the negative of the deceleration parameter. In classical thermodynamics, this ratio is known as the isentropic expansion factor or (for ideal gases) the adiabatic index. A more interesting fact that has come to light is that this relation holds true in the $\\Lambda$CDM model also! So, this is actually a generic result and is independent of the cosmological model used. We discuss the implications of this result on the evolution of the Universe. Finally, we determine the constraints on the effective equation of state which guarantees thermodynamic stability in our model.",

    "abstract": "This thesis investigates geometric descriptions of scattering amplitudes, with a specific focus on scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM and ABJM theory. The recent development of the field of positive geometries provides us with a suitable framework for this endeavour. In particular, we will give a detailed account of the amplituhedron, the momentum amplituhedron, and the ABJM momentum amplituhedron. Alongside these geometries, we will also discuss the ABHY associahedron, which encapsulates tree-level scattering amplitudes in bi-adjoint scalar theory. We provide a detailed introduction to these positive geometries, which includes a comprehensive discussion of their structure. For the momentum amplituhedron, ABJM momentum amplituhedron, and ABHY associahedron we give a full stratification of their boundaries, which equivalently elucidates the singularity structure of the tree-level scattering amplitudes. Notably, we show that the ABJM momentum amplituhedron has an Euler characteristic equal to one. Furthermore, we explore the interconnections between these, and other, positive geometries. These connections are in part obtained via push forwards through the scattering equations. We develop techniques to calculate these push forwards which circumvents the necessity to solve the scattering equations explicitly. Beyond tree-level, we illustrate how positive geometries can be used to describe loop integrands in planar N=4 SYM and ABJM. A new framework is established to investigate these loop geometries in the space of dual momenta. The construction relies solely on lightcones and their intersections, and the framework simultaneously encompasses the loop level structure of the amplituhedron, momentum amplituhedron, and the ABJM momentum amplituhedron. This further leads to compact general formulae for all one-loop integrands in N=4 SYM and ABJM.",

We then show that Carroll superalgebras are naturally connected to Euclidean, rather than Poincar\\'e, superalgebras. Using the real multiplet of the three-dimensional N $=1$ Euclidean supersymmetry, we construct the scalar multiplet for N $=2$ Carroll supersymmetry and develop a tensor calculus to realize the aforementioned model.

Such theories admit an elegant description in terms of bipartite tessellations of the torus known as brane tilings or dimer models. An intricate network of infrared dualities interconnects the space of such theories and partitions it into universality classes, the prediction and classification of which is a problem that naturally lends itself to a machine learning investigation. In this paper, we address a preliminary set of such enquiries. We begin by training a fully connected neural network to identify classes of Seiberg dual theories realised on $\\mathbb{Z}_m\\times\\mathbb{Z}_n$ orbifolds of the conifold and achieve $R^2=0.988$. Then, we evaluate various notions of robustness of our methods against perturbations of the space of theories under investigation, and discuss these results in terms of the nature of the neural network's learning. Finally, we employ a more sophisticated residual architecture to classify the toric phase space of the $Y^{6,0}$ theories, and to predict the individual gauged linear $\\sigma$-model multiplicities in toric diagrams thereof. In spite of the non-trivial nature of this task, we achieve remarkably accurate results; namely, upon fixing a choice of Kasteleyn matrix representative, the regressor achieves a mean absolute error of $0.021$.

Through explicit computations, we show that integrating out the explicit massive Nambu-Goldstone candidates or imposing symmetric constraints, namely the inverse Higgs constraints, to express massive modes in terms of the massless ones leads to physically distinct effective field theories. This sensitivity to the chosen method can be traced back to the homogeneous breaking of translations, the homogeneous aspect of the breaking induces a mixing between internal and spacetime symmetries at the level of the Lie algebra. This, in turn, leads to subtle discussions about the inverse Higgs constraints, in particular that they lead to a loss of generality in our specific examples.

Such combinatorial rules find their origin in the combinatorics of the cosmological polytopes of which we provide a gentle introduction to its definition and its main features.

The results indicate that there is a total of one scalar, one massless vector, and one tensor propagating degrees of freedom.

    "abstract": "The observation of gravitational waves has inaugurated a new era for testing gravitational theories in strong-field, nonlinear regimes. Gravitational waves emit during the ringdown phase of binary black hole mergers and from extreme mass ratio inspirals are particularly sensitive to the properties of black holes, making them crucial for probing deviations from general relativity. These studies need a robust foundation in black hole perturbation theory beyond general relativity. While existing studies have employed black hole perturbation theories to explore modifications beyond general relativity, they often focus on specific alternative theories or phenomenological models of quantum gravity. In this paper, we establish a modified decoupled Teukolsky formalism that is broadly applicable to spherically symmetric spacetimes without requiring a predetermined gravitational Lagrangian. This formalism uses the Newman-Penrose framework, which utilizes curvature perturbations characterized by Weyl scalars, to accommodate a wider class of spacetimes beyond general relativity. Our approach correctly handles non-Ricci-flat backgrounds and circumvents subtle analytical issues associated with effective potentials that are present in other modified Teukolsky formalisms.",

We demonstrate that while the hydrodynamic modes remain unaffected by local field redefinition, the non-hydrodynamic modes are sensitive to it and can be eliminated through an appropriate all-order redefinition. This leads to a new hydro frame, where the spectrum contains only hydrodynamic modes. We further show that the resulting stress tensor may have an infinite series in momentum space, with a convergence radius linked to the eliminated non-hydrodynamic mode, illustrating its control over the validity of the hydrodynamic expansion. In certain special cases, higher-order terms in the stress tensor under field redefinition may cancel, indicating that non-hydrodynamic modes are mere artefacts of the fluid variable choice and hold no physical significance, even if they appear to violate physical constraints.",

The SU(2)R symmetry breaking occurs during a stage of T-model (Higgs) inflation (TI) driven by an SU(2)R triplet superfield which inflates away the produced monopoles. The subsequent breaking of the remaining U(1)R x U(1)B-L symmetry, triggered due to an instability arising in the system of a pair of SU(2)R doublet superfields, leads to the production of CSs. TI is based on a quartic potential, is consistent with data thanks to the adopted hyperbolic Kaehler geometry and may be followed by successful non-thermal leptogenesis. The decay of produced CSs interprets the recent observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves with values of the superpotential coupling constants close to 10^-6-10^-8 and symmetry-breaking scales a little lower than the SUSY grand unified theory scale. A solution to the mu problem of the MSSM is also accommodated provided that mu is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the gravitino mass.",

We calculate the surface density and surface tension of a hollow structure around a black hole and compare them with the density and compressive strength of various materials that appear in nature to find the allowed parameter space. For example, granite or iron can support a hollow asteroid/planetoid/moon of the size of up to $0.1 R_\\oplus$. Along the same lines, future civilizations might build spherical structures around black holes to harvest their energy. Using the strongest material that we currently know how to make (multiwall carbon nanotube), to withstand gravity of one solar mass black hole, the shell must be constructed at distances larger than $10^4 R_\\odot$. Alternatively, a fast black hole can leave a narrow tunnel in a solid object while passing through it. For example, a $10^{22}$g black hole should leave a tunnel with a radius of $0.1$ micron, which is large enough to be seen by an optical microscope. We could look for such micro-tunnels here on Earth in very old rocks, or even glass or other solid structures in very old buildings. While our estimate gives a very small probability of finding such tunnels, looking for them does not require expensive equipment and long preparation, and the payoff might be significant.",

In 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories with fractional r-charges, there exists a special notion of high-temperature limit on higher sheets that captures data of three-dimensional topological quantum field theories arising from r-twisted circle reduction. These TQFTs are closely tied with the VOA of the 4d SCFT. We study such high-temperature limits. More specifically, we apply Di~Pietro-Komargodski type supersymmetric effective field theory techniques to r-twisted circle reductions of $(A_1,A_{2n})$ Argyres-Douglas theories, leveraging their Maruyoshi-Song Lagrangian with manifest $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. The result on the second sheet is the Gang-Kim-Stubbs family of 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY enhancing rank-$0$ theories with monopole superpotentials, whose boundary supports the Virasoro minimal model VOAs $M(2,2n+3)$. Upon topological twist, they give non-unitary TQFTs controlled by the $M(2,2n+3)$ modular tensor category (MTC). The high-temperature limit on other sheets yields their unitary or non-unitary Galois conjugates. This opens up the prospect of a broader four-supercharge perspective on the celebrated correspondence between 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs and 2d VOAs via interpolating 3d EFTs.

    "abstract": "Free-fermionic states, also known as fermionic Gaussian states, represent an important class of quantum states ubiquitous in physics. They are uniquely and efficiently described by their correlation matrix. However, in practical experiments, the correlation matrix can only be estimated with finite accuracy. This raises the question: how does the error in estimating the correlation matrix affect the trace-distance error of the state? We show that if the correlation matrix is known with an error $\\varepsilon$, the trace-distance error also scales as $\\varepsilon$ (and vice versa). Specifically, we provide distance bounds between (both pure and mixed) free-fermionic states in relation to their correlation matrix distance. Our analysis also extends to cases where one state may not be free-fermionic. Importantly, we leverage our preceding results to derive significant advancements in property testing and tomography of free-fermionic states. Property testing involves determining whether an unknown state is close to or far from being a free-fermionic state. We first demonstrate that any algorithm capable of testing arbitrary (possibly mixed) free-fermionic states would inevitably be inefficient. Then, we present an efficient algorithm for testing low-rank free-fermionic states. For free-fermionic state tomography, we provide improved bounds on sample complexity in the pure-state scenario, substantially improving over previous literature, and we generalize the efficient algorithm to mixed states, discussing its noise-robustness.",

Our theorem implies that, in a bipartite system modeled by commuting factors in Haag duality, a) all states have infinite one-shot entanglement if and only if the local factors are not of type I, b) type III factors are characterized by LOCC transitions of arbitrary precision between any two pure states, and c) the latter holds even without classical communication for type III$_{1}$ factors.

In particular, ballistic growth is impossible for $\\alpha < 1$, diffusive growth is impossible for $\\alpha < 1/2$, and any finite dynamical exponent becomes impossible for sufficiently small $\\alpha$.

The strong coupling expansion involves the sum of the `perturbative' part, given by series in $1/\\sqrt\\lambda$, and the `non-perturbative' part, given by an infinite sum of exponentially small terms, each accompanied by a series in $1/\\sqrt\\lambda$ with factorially growing coefficients.

A natural extrapolation away from integer R\\'enyi parameters, suggested by the triway cut problem, implies the holographic conjecture $S_R=2EW$, where $S_R$ is the reflected entropy and $EW$ is the entanglement wedge cross-section. Minimal triway cuts can be formulated as integer programs which cannot be relaxed to find a dual maximal flow/bit-thread description. This sheds light on the gap between the existence of tripartite entanglement in holographic states and the bipartite entanglement structure motivated by bit-threads. In particular, we prove that the Markov gap that measures tripartite entanglement is lower bounded by the integrality gap of the integer program that computes the triway cut.",

Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and outof-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.",

In this work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced dynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly facilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet theory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion is minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate for an effective Lindblad generator, hence significantly reducing the complexity of the search for an effective Lindblad generator in many (though not all) cases.

    "abstract": "We study the spectral properties of a class of random matrices of the form $S_n^{-} = n^{-1}(X_1 X_2^* - X_2 X_1^*)$ where $X_k = \\Sigma^{1/2}Z_k$, for $k=1,2$, $Z_k$'s are independent $p\\times n$ complex-valued random matrices, and $\\Sigma$ is a $p\\times p$ positive semi-definite matrix, independent of the $Z_k$'s. We assume that $Z_k$'s have independent entries with zero mean and unit variance. The skew-symmetric/skew-Hermitian matrix $S_n^{-}$ will be referred to as a random commutator matrix associated with the samples $X_1$ and $X_2$. We show that, when the dimension $p$ and sample size $n$ increase simultaneously, so that $p/n \\to c \\in (0,\\infty)$, there exists a limiting spectral distribution (LSD) for $S_n^{-}$, supported on the imaginary axis, under the assumptions that the spectral distribution of $\\Sigma$ converges weakly and the entries of $Z_k$'s have moments of sufficiently high order. This nonrandom LSD can be described through its Stieltjes transform, which satisfies a coupled Mar\\v{c}enko-Pastur-type functional equations. In the special case when $\\Sigma = I_p$, we show that the LSD of $S_n^{-}$ is a mixture of a degenerate distribution at zero (with positive mass if $c > 2$), and a continuous distribution with a symmetric density function supported on a compact interval on the imaginary axis. Moreover, we show that the companion matrix $S_n^{+} = \\Sigma_n^\\frac{1}{2}(Z_1Z_2^* + Z_2Z_1^*)\\Sigma_n^\\frac{1}{2}$, under identical assumptions, has an LSD supported on the real line, which can be similarly characterized.",

    "abstract": "Spatially modulated symmetries have emerged since the discovery of fractons, which characterize unconventional topological phases with mobility-constrained quasiparticle excitations. On the other hand, non-invertible duality defects have attracted substantial attention in communities of high energy and condensed matter physics due to their deep insight into quantum anomalies and exotic phases of matter. However, the connection between these exotic symmetries and defects has not been fully explored. In this paper, we construct concrete lattice models with non-invertible duality defects via gauging spatially modulated symmetries and investigate their exotic fusion rules. Specifically, we construct spin models with subsystem symmetries or dipole symmetries on one, two, and three-dimensional lattices. Gauging subsystem symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects whose fusion rules involve $0$-form subsystem charges in two dimensions and higher-form operators that correspond to ``lineon'' excitations (excitations which are mobile along one-dimensional line) in three dimensions. Gauging dipole symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects with dipole algebras that describe a hierarchical structure between global and dipole charges. Notably, the hierarchical structure of the dual dipole charges is inverted compared with the original ones. Our work provides a unified and systematic analytical framework for constructing exotic duality defects by gauging relevant symmetries.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel framework for the probabilistic modelling of random fourth order material tensor fields, with a focus on tensors that are physically symmetric and positive definite (SPD), of which the elasticity tensor is a prime example. Given the critical role that spatial symmetries and invariances play in determining material behaviour, it is essential to incorporate these aspects into the probabilistic description and modelling of material properties. In particular, we focus on spatial point symmetries or invariances under rotations, a classical subject in elasticity. Following this, we formulate a stochastic modelling framework using a Lie algebra representation via a memoryless transformation that respects the requirements of positive definiteness and invariance. With this, it is shown how to generate a random ensemble of elasticity tensors that allows an independent control of strength, eigenstrain, and orientation. The procedure also accommodates the requirement to prescribe specific spatial symmetries and invariances for each member of the whole ensemble, while ensuring that the mean or expected value of the ensemble conforms to a potentially 'higher' class of spatial invariance. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the set of SPD tensors forms a differentiable manifold, which geometrically corresponds to an open cone within the ambient space of symmetric tensors. Thus, we explore the mathematical structure of the underlying sample space of such tensors, and introduce a new distance measure or metric, called the 'elasticity metric', between the tensors.",

In this paper, we demonstrate how LQG can be used to study the SLE loop measure. Firstly, we show that for $\\kappa\\in (8/3,8)$, the loop intensity measure of the conformal loop ensemble agrees with the SLE loop measure as defined by Zhan (2021). The former was initially considered by Kemppainen and Werner (2016) for $\\kappa\\in (8/3,4]$, and the latter was constructed for $\\kappa\\in (0,8)$. Secondly, we establish a duality for the SLE loop measure between $\\kappa$ and $16/\\kappa$. Thirdly, we obtain the exact formula for the moment of the electrical thickness for the shape (probability) measure of the SLE loop, which in the regime $\\kappa\\in (8/3,8)$ was conjectured by Kenyon and Wilson (2004). This relies on the exact formulae for the reflection coefficient and the one-point disk correlation function in Liouville conformal field theory. Finally, we compute several multiplicative constants associated with the SLE loop measure, which are not only of intrinsic interest but also used in our companion paper relating the conformal loop ensemble to the imaginary DOZZ formulae.",

Similar to finding two-dimensional irreps for encoding a logical qubit in error correction, we identify trivial irreps of finite groups that guarantee the satisfaction of the quantum metrology conditions. To demonstrate our framework, we analyze the SU(2) estimation with symmetric states in which three parameters define a global rotation of an ensemble of $N$ qubits. For even $N$, we find that tetrahedral symmetry and, with fine-tuning, $S_{3}$ symmetry, are minimal symmetry groups providing optimal probe states for SU(2) estimation, but that the quantum metrology conditions can also be satisfied in an entanglement-assisted setting by using a maximally entangled state of two spin-$N/2$ representations for any $N$.

Our method also strongly suggests the existence of such crossings below $C\\sqrt{\\log\\log N}$, for $C$ large enough. As a consequence, we also obtain connectivity properties of the set of thick points of a random walk.   We rely on an isomorphism between the DGFF and the random walk loop soup (RWLS) with critical intensity $\\alpha=1/2$, and further extend our study to the occupation field of the RWLS for all subcritical intensities $\\alpha\\in(0,1/2)$. For the RWLS in $B_N$, we show that for $\\lambda$ large enough, there exist low crossings of $B_N$, remaining below $\\lambda$, even though the average occupation time is of order $\\log N$. Our results thus uncover a non-trivial phase-transition for this highly-dependent percolation model.

This work is the second part of a series of two papers. It relies heavily on tools and techniques developed for the RWLS in the first part, especially surgery arguments on loops, which were made possible by a separation result in the RWLS.

    "abstract": "The Lie-point symmetry method is used to find some closed-form solutions for a constitutive equation modeling stress in elastic materials. The partial differential equation (PDE), which involves a power law with arbitrary exponent n, was investigated by Mason and his collaborators (Magan et al., Wave Motion, 77, 156-185, 2018). The Lie algebra for the model is five-dimensional for the shearing exponent n > 0, and it includes translations in time, space, and displacement, as well as time-dependent changes in displacement and a scaling symmetry. Several reductions and closed-form solutions for the model are established by utilizing different combinations of Lie symmetries, both for general n and for the specific case where n = 1. Furthermore, it is shown that for general n > 0 the model has interesting conservation laws which are computed with symbolic software using the scaling symmetry of the given PDE.",

In other words, the Liouville quantum gravity surface and the pair of space-filling SLEs can be deterministically reconstructed from the permuton.

In this paper, we consider and compare several possible extensions of these fluctuation theorems to quantum systems. In addition to the direct two-time measurement approach whose discussion is based on (LMP 114:32 (2024)), we discuss a variant where measurements are performed indirectly on an auxiliary system called ancilla, and which allows to retrieve non-trivial statistical information using ancilla state tomography. We also show that modular theory provides a way to extend the classical notion of phase space contraction rate to the quantum domain, which leads to a third extension of the fluctuation theorems. We further discuss the quantum version of the principle of regular entropic fluctuations, introduced in the classical context in (Nonlinearity 24, 699 (2011)). Finally, we relate the statistical properties of these various notions of entropy production to spectral resonances of quantum transfer operators. The obtained results shed a new light on the nature of entropic fluctuations in quantum statistical mechanics.",

We also present elegant mock theta conjecture-like identities and mixed mock modular properties for certain examples of $1/2$-level string functions.

By applying a combined mean-field and semiclassical space-time rescaling to the dynamics in both the Gross--Pitaevskii and hard-core limit regimes, we prove that the local one-particle mass, momentum, and energy densities of the many-body system can be quantitatively approximated by solutions to the compressible Euler system in the strong sense, up to the first blow-up time of the fluid description, as the number of particles tends to infinity. In the hard-core limit regime, two novel results are presented. First, we rigorously prove, for the first time, that the internal energy of the fluid takes the form $4\\pi \\mathfrak{c}_{0}\\rho^{2}$ (equivalently, pressure $P=2\\pi \\mathfrak{c}_{0}\\rho^{2}$), arising solely from the kinetic energy density of the many-body system, rather than the interaction energy density, marking a fundamental difference from the Gross--Pitaevskii and other mean-field regimes. Second, the newly discovered coupling constant $\\mathfrak{c}_{0}$ is the electrostatic capacity of the interaction potential, corresponding to the scattering length of the hard-core potential. Furthermore, in other limiting regimes, including those beyond the Gross--Pitaevskii regime, we find that the limiting equation is described by an eikonal system, offering a rigorous first-principle justification for using the ``geometric optics approximation'' to describe the dynamics of ultracold Bose gases.",

In particular, we study two systems, Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection and a closely related problem without thermal diffusion. In the former, bounds on the vertical heat transfer, given by the Nusselt number, with respect to the strength of the buoyancy force, characterized by the Rayleigh number, are derived. These bounds hold for a broad range of applications, allowing for non-flat boundaries, any sufficiently smooth positive slip coefficient, and are valid over all ranges of the Prandtl number, a system parameter determined by the fluid. For the thermally non-diffusive system, regularity estimates are proven. Up to a certain order, these bounds hold uniformly in time, which, combined with estimates for their growth, provide insight into the long-time behavior. In particular, solutions converge to the hydrostatic equilibrium, where the fluid's velocity vanishes and the buoyancy force is balanced by the pressure gradient.",

The underlying mathematical framework to model many of these systems must incorporate the spatial transport of particles and their interactions, as well as changes to their copy numbers, all of which can be formulated in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. The probabilistic representation of these processes is complex because of combinatorial aspects arising due to nonlinear interactions and varying particle numbers. This review presents the main field theory representations of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, which handle these issues `under-the-hood'. First, we focus on bringing techniques familiar to theoretical physicists -- such as second quantization, Fock space, and path integrals -- back into the classical domain of reaction-diffusion systems. We demonstrate how various field theory representations can all be unified under a single basis-independent representation. We then extend existing quantum-based methods and notation to work directly on the level of the unifying representation, and we illustrate how they can be used to consistently obtain previous known results, such as numerical discretizations and relations between model parameters at multiple scales. Throughout the work, we contextualize how these representations mirror well-known models of chemical physics depending on their spatial resolution, as well as the corresponding macroscopic limits. The framework presented here may find applications in a diverse set of scientific fields, including physical chemistry, theoretical ecology, epidemiology, game theory and socio-economical models of complex systems. The presentation is done in a self-contained educational and unifying manner such that it can be followed by researchers across several fields.",

However, the charging requirements of e-bikes often hinder their deployment and optimal functioning. This study examines the spatiotemporal variations in battery levels of Barcelona's BSS, revealing that bikes stationed near the city centre tend to have shorter rest periods and lower average battery levels. Additionally, to improve the management of e-bike fleets, a Markov-chain approach is developed to predict both bike availability and battery levels.

We generalize this approach to supergravity and derive a metric ansatz that ensures the above properties for Petrov-type $I$. Our derivation is based on the Benenti-Francavilla ansatz for metrics admitting two commuting Killing vectors and an irreducible Killing tensor. We find additional constraints that guarantee the existence of two shear-free null geodesic congruences and the separability of the Klein-Gordon equation. The resulting class of metrics belongs to a certain sector of Petrov type $I$, called $I_B$, whose algebraically special subsector contains only type $D$. For this class, a direct integration of the supergravity equations seems possible. We also show that these spacetimes admit a general description of the generalized photon and massive particle surfaces recently introduced in connection with black hole shadows.",

Conversely, we construct a special perm algebra structure and a special pre-Lie algebra structure on the vector space of Laurent polynomials such that the tensor product with a pre-Lie algebra and a perm algebra being a Lie algebra structure characterizes the pre-Lie algebra and the perm algebra respectively. This is called the affinization of a pre-Lie algebra and a perm algebra respectively. Furthermore we extend such correspondences to the context of bialgebras, that is, there is a bialgebra structure for a perm algebra or a pre-Lie algebra which could be characterized by the fact that its affinization by a quadratic pre-Lie algebra or a quadratic perm algebra respectively gives an infinite-dimensional Lie bialgebra. In the case of perm algebras, the corresponding bialgebra structure is called a perm bialgebra, which can be independently characterized by a Manin triple of perm algebras as well as a matched pair of perm algebras. The notion of the perm Yang-Baxter equation is introduced, whose symmetric solutions give rise to perm bialgebras. There is a correspondence between symmetric solutions of the perm Yang-Baxter equation in perm algebras and certain skew-symmetric solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation in the infinite-dimensional Lie algebras induced from the perm algebras.

This is a decomposition method based on the idea of asymptotic analysis. Compared to PINN, the ASPINN method has a strong fitting ability for solving SPDEs due to the placement of exponential layers at the boundary layer. Unlike GKPINN, ASPINN lessens the number of fully connected layers, thereby reducing the training cost more effectively. Moreover, ASPINN theoretically approximates the solution at the boundary layer more accurately, which accuracy is also improved compared to GKPINN. We demonstrate the effect of ASPINN by solving diverse classes of SPDEs, which clearly shows that the ASPINN method is promising in boundary layer problems.

    "abstract": "We solve a long-standing open problem of determining the Fourier dimension of the Mandelbrot canonical cascade measure (MCCM). This problem of significant interest was raised by Mandelbrot in 1976 and reiterated by Kahane in 1993. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Fourier dimension of the MCCM for random weights $W$ satisfying the condition $\\mathbb{E}[W^t]<\\infty$ for all $t>0$. As a corollary, we prove that the MCCM is Salem if and only if the random weight has a specific two-point distribution. In addition, we show that the MCCM is Rajchman with polynomial Fourier decay whenever the random weight satisfies $\\mathbb{E}[W^{1+\\delta}]<\\infty$ for some $\\delta>0$. As a consequence, we discover that, in the Biggins-Kyprianou's boundary case, the Fourier dimension of the MCCM exhibits a second order phase transition at the inverse temperature $\\beta = 1/2$; we establish the upper Frostman regularity for MCCM; and we obtain a Fourier restriction estimate for MCCM.   While the precise Fourier dimension formula seems to be a little magical in the realm of cascade theory, it turns out to be fairly natural in the context of vector-valued martingales. Indeed, the vector-valued martingales will play key roles in our new formalism of actions by multiplicative cascades on finitely additive vector measures, which is the major novelty of this paper.",

Turbulence in common fluids like water and air, mathematically described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE), engenders spontaneous self-stretching and twisting of vortex lines, generating a complex hierarchy of structures. While the INSE are routinely used to describe turbulence, their regularity remains unproven; the implicit assumption being that the self-stretching is ultimately regularized by viscosity, preventing any singularities. Here, we uncover an inviscid regularizing mechanism stemming from self-stretching itself, by analyzing the flow topology as perceived by an observer aligned with the vorticity vector undergoing amplification. While, initially, vorticity amplification occurs via increasing twisting of vortex lines, a regularizing anti-twist spontaneously emerges to prevent unbounded growth. By isolating a vortex, we additionally demonstrate the genericity of this self-regularizing anti-twist. Our work, directly linking dynamics of vortices to turbulence statistics, reveals how the Navier-Stokes dynamics avoids the development of singularities even without the aid of viscosity.",

We study in particular solutions which enjoy some a priori Besov regularity in space, as expected for initial data chosen from a driven, turbulent steady-state ensemble. The empirical basis for this regularity hypothesis, uniform in Reynolds number, is carefully discussed, including evidence from numerical simulations of turbulent flows that incorporate thermal fluctuations. Considering the initial-value problem for the Landau-Lifschitz equations, our main result is that the infinite Reynolds number limit is a space-time statistical solution of the incompressible Euler equations in the sense of Vishik \\& Fursikov. Such solutions are described by a probability measure on space-time velocity fields whose realizations are weak or distributional solutions of the incompressible Euler equations, each with the same prescribed initial data. In conjunction with recent numerical evidence that these probability measures are non-trivial, our theorem shows that the mathematical non-uniqueness of the solutions of the Cauchy problem for Euler, as revealed by convex integration studies, may be physically realized. In support of the theory of spontaneous stochasticity, any persistent randomness in the infinite-Reynolds limit is associated to a nontrivial probability distribution over non-unique solutions of the ideal Euler equations.",

    "abstract": "Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\\Delta=3\\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.",

    "abstract": "We provide a uniform framework to compute the exact distribution of the number of minima/maxima in three different random walk landscape models in one dimension. The landscape is generated by the trajectory of a discrete-time continuous space random walk with arbitrary symmetric and continuous jump distribution at each step. In model I, we consider a ``free'' random walk of $N$ steps. In model II, we consider a ``meander landscape'' where the random walk, starting at the origin, stays non-negative up to $N$ steps. In model III, we study a ``first-passage landscape'' which is generated by the trajectory of a random walk that starts at the origin and stops when it crosses the origin for the first time. We demonstrate that while the exact distribution of the number of minima is different in the three models, for each model it is universal for all $N$, in the sense that it does not depend on the jump distribution as long as it is symmetric and continuous. In the last two cases we show that this universality follows from a non trivial mapping to the Sparre Andersen theorem known for the first-passage probability of discrete-time random walks with symmetric and continuous jump distribution. Our analytical results are in excellent agreement with our numerical simulations.",

The authors aim to develop a coupled system of equations that captures both scales, using a variational principle formulated with Lagrangians defined on the full flow, and incorporating stochastic transport constraints. The approach smooths the noise term along time, leading to stochastic dynamics as a regularization parameter approaches zero. Initially, fixed noise terms are considered, resulting in a generalized stochastic Euler equation, which becomes problematic as the regularization parameter diminishes. The study then examines connections with existing stochastic frameworks and proposes a new variational principle that couples noise dynamics with large-scale fluid motion. This comprehensive framework provides a stochastic representation of large-scale dynamics while accounting for fine-scale components. The evolution of the small-scale velocity component is governed by a linear Euler equation with random coefficients, influenced by large-scale transport, stretching, and pressure forcing.",

    "abstract": "A Chern-Simons matrix model was proposed by Dorey, Tong, and Turner to describe non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall effect. In this paper we study the Hilbert space of the Chern-Simons matrix model from a geometric quantization point of view. We show that the Hilbert space of the Chern-Simons matrix model can be identified with the space of sections of a line bundle on the quiver variety associated to a framed Jordan quiver. We compute the character of the Hilbert space using localization technique. Using a natural isomorphism between vortex moduli space and a Beilinson-Drinfeld Schubert variety, we prove that the ground states wave functions are flat sections of a bundle of conformal blocks associated to a WZW model. In particular they solve a Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. We show that there exists a natural action of the deformed double current algebra (DDCA) on the Hilbert space, moreover the action is irreducible.   We define and study the conformal limit of the Chern-Simons matrix model. We show that the conformal limit of the Hilbert space is an irreducible integrable module of $\\widehat{\\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$ with level identified with the matrix model level. Moreover, we prove that $\\widehat{\\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$ generators can be obtained from scaling limits of matrix model operators, which settles a conjecture of Dorey-Tong-Turner. The key to the proof is the construction of a Yangian $Y(\\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ action on the conformal limit of the Hilbert space, which we expect to be equivalent to the $Y(\\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ action on the integrable $\\widehat{\\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$ modules constructed by Uglov.

The posterior distribution is obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for which we emulate the transport model with a Gaussian process to lower computational costs.

The major sources of the photons in Angantyr include hard processes, Parton showers, and resonance decay. The multiparton interactions and hadronic rescatterings significantly increase the photon yield. The model shows a good match with the available experimental data at high $p_T$. The difference in yield at low $p_T $ suggests that Quark Gluon Plasma of $T_{eff}$ = 0.167 GeV/c in central Au-Au collision at 200 GeV is formed, the new effective temperature is less than the ones extracted without removing background photons. At low $p_T$ the decay photon spectra scales with $(\\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\\eta})^{1.25}$, the scaling is independent of collision energy and system size. The scaling no longer holds at high $p_T$ and the spectra become beam energy dependent. The scaled $p_T$ spectra of p-p and d-Au collisions show an opposite trend at high $p_T$, their scaled yield is greater than the Au-Au collision at the same energy.",

The used Phase-Imaging Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance technique allowed for the discovery of a so far unknown second long-lived isomer. All three states were produced directly in proton-induced fission on a uranium target, whereas only the isomeric states were populated in the $\\beta$ decay of the $^{114}$Ru ground state with spin-parity $0^+$. We propose spin-parity assignments of $(6^-)$ for the ground state, and $(3^+)$ and $(0^-)$ for the isomers. They resolve the puzzle of anomalous fission yields of this isotope despite the existing literature assigning a low angular momentum to the ground state. The experimental evidence is further supported by a detailed analysis based on mean-field calculations with the BSkG3 model. As for many other nuclei in this mass region, considering triaxial shapes is decisive for the interpretation of low-lying states of this nucleus. The discovery of a new isomer in $^{114}$Rh and our theoretical work challenge the currently adopted spin-parity assignments in this and several other odd-odd neutron-rich Rh isotopes.",

In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo beta+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.",

    "title": "Effect of isoscalar and isovector scalar fields on baryon semileptonic decays in nuclear matter",
    "abstract": "The precise determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements is very important, because it could be a clue to new physics beyond Standard Theory. This is particular true of $V_{ud}$, because it is the main contribution to the unitary condition of the CKM matrix elements. The level of accuracy for the test of the unitarity involving the element $V_{ud}$ is now of the order of $10^{-4}$. Because the precise data for $V_{ud}$ is usually extracted from super-allowed nuclear $\\beta$ decay, it is quite significant to investigate the breaking of SU(3) flavor symmetry on the weak vector coupling constant in nuclear matter. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the isoscalar scalar ($\\sigma$) and the isovector scalar ($\\delta$ or $a_0$) mean-fields affect the weak vector and axial-vector coupling constants for semileptonic baryon (neutron, $\\Lambda$ or $\\Xi^-$) decay in asymmetric nuclear matter. To do so, we use the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, where nuclear matter consists of nucleons including quark degrees of freedom bound by the self-consistent exchange of scalar and vector mesons. We pay careful attention to the center of mass correction to the quark currents in matter. We then find that, for neutron $\\beta$ decay in asymmetric nuclear matter, the defect of the vector coupling constant due to the $\\delta$ field can be of the order of $10^{-4}$ at the nuclear saturation density, which is the same amount as the level of the current uncertainty in the measurements. It is also interesting that, in neutron-rich matter, there exists a certain low density at which isospin symmetry is restored, that is, the $u$-$d$ quark mass difference vanishes. We conclude that the effect of the isoscalar scalar and the isovector scalar fields should be considered in baryon semileptonic decays in nuclei.",

Machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the phase(s), low density, and high radiation length of the designed Al-Ti-V alloys. Al-Ti-V alloys with various compositions for single-phase and dual-phase mixtures, liquidus temperature, and density values are obtained using the Latin hypercube sampling method in TC Python Thermo-Calc software. The obtained dataset is utilized to train the machine-learning algorithms. Classification algorithms such as XGBoost and regression models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest regressor have been used to compute the number of phases, radiation length, and density respectively. The XGBoost algorithms show an accuracy of $98\\%$, the Linear regression model shows an accuracy of $94\\%$, and the Random Forest regressor model is accurate up to $99\\%$. The developed Al-Ti-V alloys exhibit high radiation length as well as a good combination of high elastic modulus and toughness due to the synergistic effect of the presence of hard $Al_3Ti$ phase along with a minor volume fraction of FCC $(Al)_{ss}$ solid solution phase mixture. The comparison of our alloys, alloy-1 ($Al_{75.2}Ti_{22.8}V_{2}$) and alloy-2 ($Al_{89}Ti_{10}V_{1}$) shows an increase in the radiation length by seven-times and a decrease in the density by two to three times as compared to stainless steel 304, the preferred material for constructing beampipes in low-energy particle accelerators. Further, we experimentally verify the elastic modulus of the alloy-1 and compute the FoM equal to 0.416, which is better than other existing materials for beampipes in low-energy experiments.",

Energy-energy correlator (EEC) is an excellent jet substructure observable owning to its strong sensitivity to jet physics at different scales. We perform a complete realistic simulation on medium modification of heavy and light flavor jet EEC in heavy-ion collisions. A clear flavor hierarchy is observed for jet EEC in both vacuum and QGP due to the mass effect. The medium modification of inclusive jet EEC at different angular scales exhibits very rich structure: suppression at intermediate angles, and enhancement at small and large angles, which can be well explained by the interplay of mass effect, energy loss, medium-induced radiation and medium response. These unique features of jet EEC are shown to probe the physics of jet-medium interaction at different scales, and can be readily validated by upcoming experiments.",

The data were collected by the PHENIX experiment in 2014 and 2016 with integrated luminosity of 14.5~nb$^{-1}$. The second Fourier coefficient ($v_2$) of the azimuthal distribution of $J/\\psi$ is determined as a function of the transverse momentum ($p_T$) using the event-plane method. The measurements were performed for several selections of collision centrality: 0\\%--50\\%, 10\\%--60\\%, and 10\\%-40\\%. We find that in all cases the values of $v_2(p_T)$, which quantify the elliptic flow of J$/\\psi$, are consistent with zero. The results are consistent with measurements at midrapidity, indicating no significant elliptic flow of the J$/\\psi$ within the quark-gluon-plasma medium at collision energies of $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV.",

    "abstract": "We present the first forward-rapidity measurements of elliptic anisotropy of open-heavy-flavor muons at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The measurements are based on data samples of Au$+$Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV collected by the PHENIX experiment in 2014 and 2016 with integrated luminosity of 14.5~nb$^{-1}$. The measurements are performed in the pseudorapidity range $1.2<|\\eta|<2$ and cover transverse momenta $1<p_T<4$~GeV/$c$. The elliptic flow of charged hadrons as a function of transverse momentum is also measured in the same kinematic range. We observe significant elliptic flow for both charged hadrons and heavy-flavor muons. The results show clear mass ordering of elliptic flow of light- and heavy-flavor particles. The magnitude of the measured $v_2$ is comparable to that in the midrapidity region. This indicates that there is no strong longitudinal dependence in the quark-gluon-plasma evolution between midrapidity and the rapidity range of this measurement at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$~GeV.",

    "title": "First observation of strange baryon enhancement with effective energy in pp collisions at the LHC",
    "abstract": "The production of (multi-)strange hadrons is measured at midrapidity in proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV as a function of the local charged-particle multiplicity in the pseudorapidity interval ${|\\eta|<0.5}$ and of the very-forward energy measured by the ALICE Zero-Degree Calorimeters (ZDC). The latter provides information on the effective energy available for particle production in the collision once subtracted from the centre-of-mass energy. The yields of ${\\rm K}^{0}_{\\rm{S}}$, $\\Lambda+\\overline{\\Lambda}$, and $\\Xi^{-}+\\overline{\\Xi}^{+}$ per charged-particle increase with the effective energy. In addition, this work exploits a multi-differential approach to decouple the roles of local multiplicity and effective energy in such an enhancement. The results presented in this article provide new insights into the interplay between global properties of the collision, such as the initial available energy in the event, and the locally produced final hadronic state, connected to the charged-particle multiplicity at midrapidity. Notably, a strong increase of strange baryon production with effective energy is observed for fixed charged-particle multiplicity at midrapidity. These results are discussed within the context of existing phenomenological models of hadronisation implemented in different tunes of the PYTHIA 8 event generator.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a fully-corrected measurement of the energy-energy correlator (EEC) within jets in pp collisions. The EEC traces the energy flow as a highly energetic parton undergoes a QCD shower followed by the confinement of partons into hadrons, probing the correlation function of the energy flow inside jets. The EEC observable is measured as a function of the charged particle pair angular distance, $R_{\\rm L}$, for $20 < p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm ch \\, jet} < 80$ GeV/$c$. In the perturbative region (large $R_{\\rm L}$), a good agreement between the data and a next-to-leading-log perturbative QCD calculation is observed. In the non-perturbative region (small $R_{\\rm L}$), the data exhibits a linear $R_{\\rm L}$ dependence. There is a transition region in between, characterized by a turnover in the EEC distribution, corresponding to the confinement process. The peak of this transition region is located at $2.42 \\pm 0.17$ GeV/$c/\\langle p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm ch \\, jet}\\rangle$ for jets of various energies, indicating a common energy scale for the hadronization process. State-of-the-art Monte Carlo event generators are compared with the measurements, and can be used to constrain the parton shower and hadronization mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The ALICE Collaboration at the CERN LHC has measured the inclusive production cross section of isolated photons at midrapidity as a function of the photon transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}^{\\gamma}$), in Pb-Pb collisions in different centrality intervals, and in pp collisions, at centre-of-momentum energy per nucleon pair of $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. The photon transverse momentum range is between 10-14 and 40-140 GeV/$c$, depending on the collision system and on the Pb-Pb centrality class. The result extends to lower $p_{\\rm T}^{\\gamma}$ than previously published results by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the same collision energy. The covered pseudorapidity range is $|\\eta^{\\gamma}| <0.67$. The isolation selection is based on a charged particle isolation momentum threshold $p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm iso,~ch} = 1.5$ GeV/$c$ within a cone of radii $R=0.2$ and $0.4$. The nuclear modification factor is calculated and found to be consistent with unity in all centrality classes, and also consistent with the HG-PYTHIA model, which describes the event selection and geometry biases that affect the centrality determination in peripheral Pb-Pb collisions. The measurement is compared to next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations and to the measurements of isolated photons and Z$^0$ bosons from the CMS experiment, which are all found to be in agreement.",

    "title": "Efficient transmutation of long-lived fission products in a Gamma Factory beam driven advanced nuclear energy system",
    "abstract": "The Gamma Factory (GF) project aims to generate high-intensity $\\gamma$-ray beams of tunable energy and relatively small energy spread. Such beams can be optimized to generate an intense photo-neutron source, capable of driving an advanced nuclear energy system (ANES) for nuclear waste transmutation and supplying electrical power that is necessary for the GF operation mode of the Large Hadron Collider storage ring. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of driving ANES with the GF beam which is optimized to maximize the neutron production rate. The dependence of the ANES thermal power on the distance between the positions of the ANES and the GF $\\gamma$-ray source is evaluated. For the $\\gamma$-ray beam reaching the intensity of $\\sim$$10^{19}$ photons per second, the ANES thermal power could exceed $500\\,$MWt. Under the assumption that ANES operates over $20$ years, the transmutation rate could reach $30\\%$ for five typical long-lived fission products (LLFPs): $^{79}$Se, $^{99}$Tc, $^{107}$Pd, $^{129}$I, $^{137}$Cs. Our comparative studies show that although the neutron production efficiency of the GF $\\gamma$-ray beam (per MW of the beam power) is approximately $14$ times lower than that of the $500\\,$MeV proton beam, the overall net ANES power production efficiency for the GF beam driver scheme could be comparable to that of the proton beam driver scheme, while providing additional transmutation capacity, not available for the proton beam driven scheme. It is suggested that the GF-based ANES could provide a viable solution for the efficient transmutation of LLFPs without isotopic separation.",

    "abstract": "Systematic study of theoretical estimation of nuclear cross section of charged particle induced reactions on rare earth nuclei has been carried out. The production cross section of the $^{150,149,148,146,144,143,141}$Pm and $^{149,147}$Nd nuclei were calculated theoretically via proton induced reaction on neodymium using TALYS (version 1.96) code in the default mode, with different combination of nuclear models as well as using adjusted nuclear model parameters from reaction threshold to the proton energy upto 65 MeV. The theoretically computed results were compared with the experimental results taken from EXFOR database and literature, reported by various research groups. Moreover, the effect of the various Level Density Models (LDMs), Preequilibrium Models (PEs), Optical Model Potentials (OMPs), gamma Strength Functions ($\\gamma$SFs) in the cross section calculation were taken into consideration. The present theoretical analysis will help to understand the theory of nuclear reaction models and improve the evaluated nuclear data libraries.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as a powerful tool for studying jet substructure, with promising applications such as probing the hadronization transition, analyzing the quark-gluon plasma, and improving the precision of top quark mass measurements. The projected $N$-point correlator measures correlations between $N$ final-state particles by tracking the largest separation between them, showing a scaling behavior related to DGLAP splitting functions. These correlators can be analytically continued in $N$, commonly referred to as $\\nu$-correlators, allowing access to non-integer moments of the splitting functions. Of particular interest is the $\\nu \\to 0$ limit, where the small momentum fraction behavior of the splitting functions requires resummation. Originally, the computational complexity of evaluating $\\nu$-correlators for $M$ particles scaled as $2^{2M}$, making it impractical for real-world analyses. However, by using recursion, we reduce this to $M 2^M$, and through the FastEEC method of dynamically resolving subjets, $M$ is replaced by the number of subjets. This breakthrough enables, for the first time, the computation of $\\nu$-correlators for LHC data. In practice, limiting the number of subjets to 16 is sufficient to achieve percent-level precision, which we validate using known integer-$\\nu$ results and convergence tests for non-integer $\\nu$. We have implemented this in an update to FastEEC and conducted an initial study of power-law scaling in the perturbative regime as a function of $\\nu$, using CMS Open Data on jets. The results agree with DGLAP evolution, except at small $\\nu$, where the anomalous dimension saturates to a value that matches the BFKL anomalous dimension. This work is meant as a first step towards detailed experimental measurements and precision theoretical studies.",

The long-standing goal of creating a predictive global model for the binding energy of a nucleus remains a significant challenge, however, and prompts the need for precise measurements of atomic masses to serve as anchor points for model developments. We present precise mass measurements of neutron-rich Ru and Pd isotopes performed at the Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade facility at Argonne National Laboratory using the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer. The masses of $^{108}$Ru, $^{110}$Ru and $^{116}$Pd were measured to a relative mass precision $\\delta m/m \\approx 10^{-8}$ via the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique, and represent an improvement of approximately an order of magnitude over previous measurements.

One such case is in the mass range of 160 for Dy, Er, Ho and Tm isotopes. In this work we attempt to constrain the Hauser-Feshbach model in the TALYS package by reproducing the available experimental data of $^{160}$Dy($p,\\gamma$)$^{161}$Ho and $^{162}$Er($p,\\gamma$)$^{163}$Tm in the $A\\sim 160$ mass region, and examine the effects of level density, gamma strength function and the optical model potential.

We show that these hadronic showers also produce neutrons; their captures can be detected with high efficiency due to the recent addition of dissolved gadolinium to Super-Kamiokande. We show that new cuts based on the neutron tagging of showers could reduce spallation backgrounds by a factor of at least four beyond present cuts. With further work, this could lead to a near-elimination of detector backgrounds above about 6 MeV, which would significantly improve the sensitivity of Super-Kamiokande. These findings heighten the importance of adding gadolinium to Hyper-Kamiokande, which is at a shallower depth. Further, a similar approach could be used in other detectors, for example, the JUNO liquid-scintillator detector, which is also at a shallower depth.",

In contrast, the $6^+_1\\to 4^+_1$ and $8^+_1\\to6^+_1$ transitions exhibit the opposite trend. We found that this anomalous asymmetry is sensitive to subtle seniority breaking effects, providing a stringent test for state-of-the-art nucleon-nucleon interactions and nuclear models. We analyzed the anomalous asymmetry using VS-IMSRG calculations across various valence spaces. Our \\textit{ab initio} results suggest that core excitations of both proton and neutron across the $Z=50$ shell are ascribed to the observed anomalous seniority breaking in the $N=50$ isotones.",

    "abstract": "The interaction of a proton with a deuteron is the simplest nuclear reaction. However, it allows the study of precursors of nuclear medium effects such as initial-state/final-state interactions (ISI/FSI). In case of hard proton knockout, the deviation of ISI/FSI from the 'standard' values may carry a signal of color transparency. In this regard, it is important to define the 'standard' as precisely as possible. This work continues previous studies within the framework of the Generalized Eikonal Approximation (GEA). The focus is on processes where the participating protons experience multiple soft rescattering on the spectator neutron. It is shown that correct treatment of deviations of the trajectories of outgoing protons from the longitudinal direction leads to a significant modification of partial amplitudes with soft rescattering of two outgoing protons and non-vanishing amplitudes with rescattering of incoming and outgoing protons. The new treatment of multiple rescattering is important in kinematics with a forward spectator neutron.",

    "abstract": "The LHC Run 5 and 6 data taking phases will bring unprecedented luminosity in high-energy proton-proton and in heavy-ion collisions. The ALICE Collaboration proposes a next-generation experiment, ALICE 3, specifically designed to operate with the future LHC. ALICE 3 will feature a large pixel-based tracking system covering eight units of pseudorapidity, complemented by advanced particle identification systems. These include silicon time-of-flight layers, a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector, a muon identification system, and an electromagnetic calorimeter. By placing the vertex detector on a retractable plate inside the beam pipe, a track pointing resolution better than 10 microns can be achieved for the transverse momentum range $p_T$>200 MeV/c. ALICE 3 will be capable of innovative measurements of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and explore new frontiers in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The detailed study of thermal and dynamical properties of QGP will be made possible by measuring low-$p_T$ heavy-flavour production, including beauty hadrons, multi-charm baryons, and charm-charm correlations. Precise multi-differential measurements of dielectron emission will allow for the exploration of chiral-symmetry restoration and the time-evolution of QGP temperature. In addition to QGP studies, ALICE 3 will make unique contributions to the physics of the hadronic phase, through femtoscopic studies of charm meson interaction potentials and searches for nuclei containing charm. This contribution covers the detector design, expected physics performance, and the current status of detector research and development.",

    "abstract": "A controversy about the possibility of dynamic effects in nuclear screening has been around for several decades. On the one hand, there is the claim that there are no dynamic effects, and that the classic Salpeter correction based on static Debye screening is all that is needed for astrophysical applications. The size of the correction is on the order of 5% in typical solar fusion reactions. On the other hand, numerical simulations have shown that there is a dynamical effect, which essentially cancels the Salpeter correction. The results of the numerical simulations were later independently confirmed. The astrophysical community, however, has so far largely ignored the possibility of dynamical screening. The present paper is meant to serve as a reminder of the controversy. Not only does the claim of an absence of a dynamical effect equally warrant an independent confirmation, but there is motivation for further investigation, such as the assessment of current laboratory experiments and a quantitative study of the dynamical effect in case it will turn out to be real.",

The method leverages principles from fuzzy logic, allowing for a more nuanced representation of particle identification by assigning degrees of membership to different particle types based on detector signals. In this contribution, a mathematical framework, based on a multivariate moment generation function, is developed that allows the derivation of the formulas used in the Identity Method in a more robust way. Moreover, within the introduced framework, the Identity Method is easily extended to cope with arbitrarily higher-order moments. The techniques developed here offer significant potential for improving the accuracy of multiplicity distribution analyses in high-energy nuclear collisions. While the primary focus of the work presented is on applications in high-energy and nuclear physics, it can also be applied in other areas where signal identification is probabilistic and data are noisy, such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and various other fields of experimental science.",

To this aim, the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model is employed to simulate reconstructable $K^{*}$ resonances in Au+Au and p+p collisions from $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}=3-39$ GeV. We obtain a good description of the resonance yields and mean transverse momenta over the whole investigated energy range. The decrease of the $K^*/K$ ratio, with increasing centrality is in line with the available experimental data. We also observe the experimenatlly measured increase in $\\langle p_{\\text{T}}\\rangle$ with increasing centrality which is interpreted as a lower reconstruction probability of low-$p_{\\text{T}}$ $K^*$ due to the $p_{\\text{T}}$ dependent absorption of the decay daughter hadrons. We conclude that the observed suppression of reconstructable $K^{*}$ resonances provides a strong sign of an extended hadronic rescattering stage at all investigated energies. Its duration increases from peripheral to central reactions as expected. Following a method, suggested by the STAR experiment, the \"duration\" of the hadronic stage is extracted using the $K^*/K$ ratios at chemical and kinetic freeze-out. The resulting lifetimes are in good agreement with the experimental data, but much shorter than the actual lifetime of the hadronic phase in the transport simulation. This indicates that the experimental method to estimate the life time of the hadronic stage is too simplified.",

One common issue is generating training data which is sufficiently realistic to give reliable results. Here we advocate using real experimental data as the source of training data and demonstrate how one might subtract background contributions through the use of probabilistic weights which can be readily applied to training data. The sPlot formalism is a common tool used to isolate distributions from different sources. However, negative sWeights produced by the sPlot technique can lead to issues in training and poor predictive power. This article demonstrates how density ratio estimation can be applied to convert sWeights to event probabilities, which we call drWeights. The drWeights can then be applied to produce the distributions of interest and are consistent with direct use of the sWeights. This article will also show how decision trees are particular well suited to converting sWeights, with the benefit of fast prediction rates and adaptability to aspects of the experimental data such as data sample size and proportions of different event sources. We also show that a double density ratio approach where the initial drWeights are reweighted by an additional classifier gives substantially better results.",

Some of these baryon resonances turn to weakly couple to the $N\\pi$, $N\\eta$, $K\\Lambda$, and $K\\Sigma$ channels, which may answer the question why they have not been established in these channels via the $\\pi N$ and $\\gamma N$ scatterings. It shows that these ``missing resonances\" may have large potentials to be established in the $N\\pi\\pi$ final state due to their large decay rates into either the $\\Delta(1232)$ or $1P$-wave nucleon resonances via the pionic decays. Further experimental search for their signals in charmonium decays at BESIII is thus strongly recommended.",

    "abstract": "As one of the predictions of perturbative QCD, the effect of color transparency has been the focus of attention in the community studying modifications of hadrons in nuclear medium for several decades. The search for this effect in reactions involving heavy nuclei can be complicated by uncertainties in nuclear characteristics (nucleon density distributions and wave functions), which can affect the interpretation of experiments. In this work, we consider the reaction $d(p,pp)n$ at $p_{\\rm lab}=15$ GeV/c caused by hard elastic $pp$ scattering, in which these uncertainties are actually reduced to the behavior of the deuteron wave function at large momenta. It is shown that for transverse momenta of the spectator neutron $\\leq 0.4$ GeV/c the choice of the deuteron wave function cannot affect the identification of the color transparency effect. A simple method for studying color transparency in $dd$ collisions is also suggested based on the identification of quasi-free $pd$ interactions.",

    "abstract": "The first-ever measurement of energy correlators within inclusive jets produced in heavy-ion collisions, revealed by the CMS Collaboration, shows a clear enhancement at large angles relative to the proton-proton (p-p) baseline. However, interpreting this enhancement is complicated due to selection bias from energy loss, which also distorts the energy correlator heavy-ion to p-p ratio in the hadronization region, hindering our understanding of parton/hadron dynamics in a colored medium. In this Letter, we introduce a new ratio of energy correlator observables that removes the leading effects of selection bias from the two-point energy correlator spectrum (E2C). Pythia and Herwig simulations show that the impact of selection bias in the E2C is reduced by an order of magnitude, while sensitivity to any other medium modifications is retained. This quantity can be obtained directly from the experimental measurements presented by CMS, as illustrated in the accompanying note.",

The cross sections are based on measurements of the B$^0_\\mathrm{s}$ $\\to$ J/$\\psi(\\mu^+\\mu^-)\\phi$(1020)(K$^+$K$^-$) and B$^+$ $\\to$ J/$\\psi(\\mu^+\\mu^-)$K$^+$ decay channels.

The measured $p_\\mathrm{T}$-differential cross sections of B$^+$ and B$^0_\\mathrm{s}$ in pp collisions are well described by fixed-order plus next-to-leading logarithm perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations. Using previous PbPb collision measurements at the same nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy, the nuclear modification factors, $R_\\mathrm{AA}$, of the B mesons are determined. For $p_\\mathrm{T}$ $\\lt$ 10 GeV/$c$, both mesons are found to be suppressed in PbPb collisions (with $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ values significantly below unity), with less suppression observed for the B$^0_\\mathrm{s}$ mesons. In this $p_\\mathrm{T}$ range, the $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ values for the B$^+$ mesons are consistent with those for inclusive charged hadrons and D$^0$ mesons. Below 10 GeV/$c$, both B$^+$ and B$^0_\\mathrm{s}$s are found to be less suppressed than either inclusive charged hadrons or D$^0$ mesons, with the B$^0_\\mathrm{s}$ $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ value consistent with unity. The $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ values found for the B$^+$ and B$^0_\\mathrm{s}$ are compared to theoretical calculations, providing constraints on the mechanism of bottom quark energy loss and hadronization in the quark-gluon plasma, the hot and dense matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.",

To address this limitation, the breakup component of fragmentation was systematically integrated into the standard PhysicsList, which successfully replicated the differential and double differential cross sections for $\\alpha$ production.

This novel physics process was then incorporated into the Geant4 framework, facilitating the calculation of dose distributions in water and tissue.

Moreover, the relationships between neutron skin thickness and some properties of nuclear structure, such as $\\alpha$-cluster formation, $\\alpha$ decay, nuclear surface, nuclear temperature, and proton radii difference of mirror nuclei, have also been investigated. It also has been shown that the neutron skin plays a crucial role in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Experimentally, an unstable nucleus with neutron skin can be generated by radioactive nuclear beam facilities, and the thickness of neutron skin could be extracted by measuring the sensitive probes, which further helps giving stringent constraints on the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter and properties of neutron stars.",

    "abstract": "In the constituent quark model, each quark inside a baryon carries 1/3 unit of the baryon number. An alternative picture exists where the center of a Y-shaped topology of gluon fields, called the baryon junction, carries a unit baryon number. Studying baryon transport over a large rapidity gap ($\\delta y$) in nuclear collisions provides a possible tool to distinguish these two pictures. A recent analysis of global data on net-proton yield at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions showed an exponential dependence on $\\delta y$ and the exponential slope does not vary with event centrality, favoring the baryon junction picture. Since junctions are flavor blind, hyperons -- baryons containing valence strange quarks -- are expected to exhibit a similar behavior as the proton. This study aims to test this prediction by analyzing hyperon yields in Au+Au collisions at various energies. We observe that net-hyperon yields, after correcting for the strangeness production suppression, adhere to the expected exponential form. The extracted slope parameters for net-$\\Lambda$, net-$\\Xi$ and net-$\\Omega$ are consistent with each other and with those of net-proton within uncertainties, and exhibit no centrality dependence, further substantiating the baryon junction picture.

Big Bang nucleosynthesis currently provides our earliest test of cosmology, and it is the only experiment currently designed that is simultaneously sensitive to all four known fundamental forces: the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force, the strong force and the weak force. Our theoretical understanding of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the measurement of the primordial abundances together represents one of the strongest pillars of the standard cosmological model. In this chapter, we will develop an intuitive understanding of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, discuss modern calculations of this process, and provide a summary of the current state-of-the-art measurements that have been made. Overall, Big Bang nucleosynthesis is in remarkable agreement with various cosmological probes, and it is this agreement that serves to strengthen our confidence in the general picture of cosmology that we have today.",

We confirm the perturbative instability of the cross section at high photon-proton-collision energies (W_gamma+p) at Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) in alpha_s and solve this issue by resumming higher-order QCD corrections, which are enhanced by a logarithm of the parton energies, using High-Energy Factorisation (HEF) in the Doubly-Logarithmic Approximation (DLA) matched to CF. Our NLO CF + DLA HEF results are in agreement with the latest HERA data, show a smaller sensitivity to the factorisation and renormalisation scales compared to Born-order results. Quark-induced channels via interference with gluon ones are found to contribute at most 20% of the cross section for W_gamma+p > 100 GeV. Our results also show that such exclusive cross sections cannot be accurately obtained from the square of usual Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) and clearly illustrate the importance of quarkonium exclusive photoproduction to advance our understanding of the 3D content of the nucleon in terms of gluons.

These data are in addition to our previously published data. Our goals in this paper are to better understand and quantify systematic uncertainties and to improve the lifetime statistical precision. We report a measured value for these runs from 2020-2022 for the neutron lifetime of 877.94+/-0.37 s; when all the data from UCNtau are averaged we report an updated value for the lifetime of 877.82+/-0.22 (statistical)+0.20-0.17 (systematic) s. We utilized improved monitor detectors, reduced our correction due to UCN upscattering on ambient gas, and employed four different main UCN detector geometries both to reduce the correction required for rate dependence and explore potential contributions due to phase space evolution.",

    "title": "Probing strangeness with event topology classifiers in pp collisions at the LHC with rope hadronization mechanism in PYTHIA",
    "abstract": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the formation of a deconfined and thermalized state of partons, known as quark-gluon plasma, leads to enhanced production of strange hadrons in contrast to proton-proton (pp) collisions, which are taken as baseline. This observation is known as strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions and is considered one of the important signatures that can signify the formation of QGP. However, in addition to strangeness enhancement, recent measurements hint at observing several heavy-ion-like features in high-multiplicity pp collisions at the LHC energies. Alternatively, event shape observables, such as charged particle multiplicity, transverse spherocity, transverse sphericity, charged particle flattenicity, and relative transverse activity classifiers, can fundamentally separate hard interaction-dominated jetty events from soft isotropic events. These features of event shape observables can probe the observed heavy-ion-like features in pp collisions with significantly reduced selection bias and can bring all collision systems on equal footing. In this article, we present an extensive summary of the strange particle ratios to pions as a function of different event classifiers using the PYTHIA~8 model with color reconnection and rope hadronization mechanisms to understand the microscopic origin of strangeness enhancement in pp collisions and also prescribe the applicability of these event classifiers in the context of strangeness enhancement. Charged-particle flattenicity is found to be most suited for the study of strangeness enhancement, and it shows a similar quantitative enhancement as seen for the analysis based on the number of multi-parton interactions.",

    "abstract": "The chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy-ion collisions reflects the local violation of ${\\cal P}$ and ${\\cal CP}$ symmetries in strong interactions and manifests as electric charge separation along the direction of the magnetic field created by the wounded nuclei. The experimental observables for the CME, such as the $\\gamma_{112}$ correlator, the $R_{\\Psi_2}(\\Delta S)$ correlator, and the signed balance functions, however, are also subject to non-CME backgrounds, including those from resonance decays.

In this work, we study the contributions from the other elements of the spin density matrix using a toy model and a multiphase transport model. We find that the real part of the $\\rho_{1-1}$ component, $\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\rho_{1-1}$, affects the CME observables in a manner opposite to that of the $\\rho_{00}$.

Both are evaluated as a function of charged-particle multiplicity obtained by two different event activity estimators.

However, the models overestimate the width in the low transverse-momentum region ($p_{\\rm T} < 3$ GeV/$c$). The per-trigger associated near-side yield increases with increasing multiplicity. Although this trend is also captured qualitatively by the considered event generators, the yield is mostly overestimated by the models in the considered kinematic range. The measurement of the shape and yield of the short-range correlation peak can help us understand the interplay between jet fragmentation and event activity, quantify the narrowing trend of the near-side peak as a function of transverse momentum and multiplicity selections in pp collisions, and search for final-state jet modification in small collision systems.   \\",

These studies represent an important step towards a thorough exploration of the imaging power of nuclear collisions at ultrarelativistic energy and the search for the imprint of nuclear structure on various flow observables in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. The findings demonstrate the potential of nuclear structure studies at the TeV energy scale and highlight that the LHC experiments can complement existing low-energy experiments on nuclear structure studies.",

This analysis is conducted using the Gaussian Estimator technique, which is insensitive to biases from correlations between different flow amplitudes. The study presents, for the first time, the centrality dependence of correlations involving up to five different symmetry planes. The correlation strength varies depending on the harmonic order of the symmetry plane and the collision centrality. Comparisons with measurements from lower energies indicate no significant differences within uncertainties. Additionally, the results are compared with hydrodynamic model calculations. Although the model predictions provide a qualitative explanation of the experimental results, they overestimate the data for some observables. This is particularly true for correlators that are sensitive to the non-linear response of the medium to initial-state anisotropies in the collision system. As these new correlators provide unique information - independent of flow amplitudes - their usage in future model developments can further constrain the properties of the strongly-interacting matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.",

These reactions are chosen in such a way that they possess positive and negative Q-values for neutron transfer channels to make the comparison more apparent. Furthermore, a comparative study on fusion barrier parameters using different proximity potentials and parametrizations is also a prime goal.   Method: A channel coupling approach within the framework of a semiclassical model is being used to investigate the role of multi-neutron transfer with positive Q-values on fusion phenomena near and below the Coulomb barrier. The fusion barrier parameters have been extracted and analyzed within the framework of seven different potential models.   Results: The sub-barrier fusion enhancement compared to the one-dimensional barrier penetration model (uncoupled) is investigated by considering collective excitations in colliding nuclei and multi-neutron transfer channels with Q $>$ 0 within the channel coupling model. Furthermore, GRAZING calculations are performed to predict the cross-section of target-like fragments after 2n pickup transfer.   Conclusion: All the fusion excitation functions (EFs) have been successfully explained by the coupled channel calculations using the channel coupling model. Only the significant effect of up to 2n pickup transfer with Q $>$ 0 was found on sub-barrier fusion. Despite having positive Q values for transfer channels, no noticeable impact of more than 2n transfer was observed. GRAZING predictions are grossly in the same order as the quantitative contribution of 2n transfer channels observed by channel coupling model calculations.",

The primary purpose of the FB detectors is to monitor luminosity and measure scattered electrons in collisions in the EIC, while the array of FF detectors is used to tag and reconstruct both charged and neutral particles that scatter at small angles. These detectors also enable a broader physics program than was initially envisioned, enhancing the EIC's research potential. The expanded capabilities have been a prime focus for engaging the broader nuclear physics community to build a robust groundwork for the EIC.

Here we present a first quantitative exploration of the reach for neutrino, QCD, and BSM physics of far-forward experiments integrated within the proposed Future Circular Collider (FCC) project as part of its proton-proton collision program (FCC-hh) at $\\sqrt{s} \\simeq 100$ TeV. We find that $10^9$ electron/muon neutrinos and $10^7$ tau neutrinos could be detected, an increase of several orders of magnitude compared to (HL-)LHC yields. We study the impact of neutrino DIS measurements at the FPF@FCC to constrain the unpolarised and spin partonic structure of the nucleon and assess their sensitivity to nuclear dynamics down to $x \\sim 10^{-9}$ with neutrinos produced in proton-lead collisions. We demonstrate that the FPF@FCC could measure the neutrino charge radius for $\\nu_{e}$ and $\\nu_\\mu$ and reach down to five times the SM value for $\\nu_\\tau$. We fingerprint the BSM sensitivity of the FPF@FCC for a variety of models, including dark Higgs bosons, relaxion-type scenarios, quirks, and millicharged particles, finding that these experiments would be able to discover LLPs with masses as large as 50 GeV and couplings as small as $10^{-8}$, and quirks with masses up to 10 TeV. Our study highlights the remarkable opportunities made possible by integrating far-forward experiments into the FCC project, and it provides new motivation for the FPF at the HL-LHC as an essential precedent to optimize the forward physics experiments that will enable the FCC to achieve its full physics potential.",

    "abstract": "PandaX-4T and XENONnT have recently reported the first measurement of nuclear recoils induced by the $^8$B solar neutrino flux, through the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\\nu$NS) channel. As long anticipated, this is an important milestone for dark matter searches as well as for neutrino physics. This measurement means that these detectors have reached exposures such that searches for low mass, $\\lesssim 10$ GeV dark matter cannot be analyzed using the background-free paradigm going forward. It also opens a new era for these detectors to be used as neutrino observatories. In this paper we assess the sensitivity of these new measurements to new physics in the neutrino sector. We focus on neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) and show that -- despite the still moderately low statistical significance of the signals -- these data already provide valuable information. We find that limits on NSI from PandaX-4T and XENONnT measurements are comparable to those derived using combined COHERENT CsI and LAr data, as well as those including the latest Ge measurement. Furthermore, they provide sensitivity to pure $\\tau$ flavor parameters that are not accessible using stopped-pion or reactor sources. With further improvements of statistical uncertainties as well as larger exposures, forthcoming data from these experiments will provide important, novel results for CE$\\nu$NS-related physics.",

Our approach combines a relativistic diffusion model with formulations based on quantum chromodynamics while utilizing numerical solutions of a Fokker-Planck equation to account for the shift and broadening of the fragmentation sources for particle-production with respect to the stopping (net-baryon) rapidity distributions. To represent the centrality dependence of charged-hadron production in asymmetric systems over a broad region of pseudorapidities, the consideration and precise modelling of the fragmentation sources - along with the central gluon-gluon source - is found to be essential.

In this work, it is shown that if the medium effects are incorporated through a density-dependent Bag pressure in the Grand Canonical ensemble, then the Euler relation is violated. If Euler relation is used then the minimum of energy per baryon does not occur at zero pressure. In order to overcome this inconsistency, we propose the medium effect of the strange quark matter in the form of chemical potential dependent Bag pressure in the grand Canonical ensemble. The density dependent Bag pressure which has been used in Grand Canonical ensemble so far can however be used in Canonical ensemble without violating the laws of thermodynamics. These prescriptions will obey the Euler relation as well as the minimum energy per baryon will coincide with the zero of pressure and hence can be considered to be self consistent. These equations of state in the Grand Canonical ensemble can be further used to construct the Mass-Radius and other structural properties of the strange quark stars as well as hybrid stars.

However, these two requirements make the determination of PDFs from lattice data very challenging. We present the application of generative machine learning algorithms to estimate the polarized and unpolarized gluon correlation functions utilizing short-distance data and extending the correlation up to $zp_z \\lesssim 14$, surpassing the current capabilities of lattice QCD calculations.

    "abstract": "There have long been questions about the limits to the validity of relativistic fluid dynamics, and whether it is being used outside its regime of validity in modern simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. An important new tool for answering this question is a causality analysis in the nonlinear regime -- if the solutions of the evolution equations do not respect relativistic causality, they are not a faithful representation of the underlying relativistic theory (in this case, quantum chromodynamics). Using this non-linear criterion, it has recently been shown that hydrodynamics is indeed being used outside its regime of validity in simulations, at least sometimes. Here we explore the phenomenological implications, particularly the quantitative effects of demanding limits on acausality in modern Bayesian parameter estimation. We find that, while typically only a small fraction of the system's energy is initially in an acausal regime, placing strict limits on the allowed energy fraction significantly changes the preferred properties of the initial condition, which in turn alters the extracted medium properties such as bulk viscosity, where large values are no longer favored. These findings highlight the importance of developing better theoretical descriptions of the early-time, out-of-equilibrium dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.",

We further incorporate a simple symmetry potential in the transport model and present constraints on the stiffness of the equation of state of nuclear matter at saturation density and on the symmetry potential. The constraints are obtained by performing a Bayesian analysis such that we can also provide an uncertainty for the estimated parameters. The posterior distribution is obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for which we emulate the transport model with a Gaussian process to lower computational costs.

The $\\gamma$-spectrum from these collisions is dominated by a 16.7 MeV peak, corresponding to the population of the $p$-wave $3/2^-$ $\\alpha$-$n$ ground-state resonance in the E1 transition from an intermediate $d$-wave $\\alpha$-$n$ state, corresponding to the $^5$He excited state around 16.7 MeV. The strength of this spectrum at the large $\\gamma$-energy endpoint decreases fast both due to kinematic factors and due to centrifugal repulsion between neutron and $\\alpha$-particle at near-zero relative energies. However, no centrifugal repulsion would occur if $s$-wave $\\alpha$-$n$ states were populated in magnetic dipole transition. Therefore, one can expect that close to the $\\gamma$-spectrum endpoint around 17.5 MeV the M1 transition could dominate, leading to additional counts in experimental spectra which could be easily misinterpreted as a background. This work presents calculations of the M1 contribution to the $d+t\\rightarrow \\alpha+n+\\gamma$ cross section caused both by convection and magnetization currents. While the first contribution was found to be negligible, the one from magnetization depends strongly on the choice of the model for the $d$-$t$ channel scattering wave function. Using $d$-$t$ interaction models from the literature, represented either by a gaussian of by a square well, resulted in unrealistically strong M1 contribution. With constructed in the present work optical folding potential, correctly representing the sizes of deuteron and triton, the M1 contribution near the endpoint is reduced to about 2$\\%$ of the 16.7-MeV E1 peak.

In addition, the existence of compact objects within the mass gap should also be supported with the help of possible new theoretical scenarios. In this letter, we propose a possible explanation for the existence of compact objects within the mass gap region. Specifically, we propose that the mass gap region could be bridged by the existence of a hybrid compact object, composed of hadronic and self interacting - non annihilating fermionic dark matter, considering that the interaction between these two fluids its only gravitational.

One drawback of the QMC approach is the requirement that the nuclear interactions need to be local, whereas chiral EFT interactions usually contain non-localities. In this work, we leverage the capability of computing second-order perturbative corrections to the ground-state energy in order to develop a self-consistent approach to including non-local operators in QMC calculations. We investigate both the deuteron and the neutron-matter equation of state in order to show the robustness of our technique, and pave the way for future QMC calculations at higher orders in the EFT, where non-local operators cannot be avoided.",

Considering the additional attractive interactions present in the $KD$ and $KD^*$ subsystems, where the states $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ are generated, we solve the Faddeev equations considering the fixed-center approximation for the mentioned three-body systems and find the existence of two doubly charmed $K^*$-like mesons, $K_{cc}^*(4309)$ and $K_{cc}^*(4449)$, with quantum numbers $I(J^P)=1/2\\,(1^-)$. Considering the respective three-body thresholds of the two systems, both $K_{cc}$-states are bound by around $60$ MeV.

    "abstract": "With the highly anticipated results from the Beam Energy Scan II program at RHIC being recently revealed, an understanding of particle-number fluctuations and their significance as a potential signature of a possible QCD critical point is crucial. Early works that embarked on this endeavor sought to estimate the fluctuations due to the presence of a critical point assuming they stay in equilibrium. From these results came the proposal to focus efforts on higher, non-Gaussian, moments of the event-by-event distributions, in particular of the number of protons. These non-Gaussian moments are especially sensitive to critical fluctuations, as their magnitudes are proportional to high powers of the critical correlation length. As the equation of state provides key input for hydrodynamical simulations of heavy-ion collisions, we estimate equilibrium fluctuations from the BEST equation of state (EoS) that includes critical features from the 3D Ising Model. In particular, the proton factorial cumulants and their dependence on non-universal mapping parameters is investigated within the BEST EoS. Furthermore, the correlation length, as a central quantity for the assessment of fluctuations in the vicinity of a critical point, is also calculated in a consistent manner with the scaling equation of state. An understanding of the equilibrium estimates of proton factorial cumulants will be useful for further comparison to estimates of out-of-equilibrium fluctuations in order to determine the magnitude of the observable fluctuations to be expected in heavy-ion collision experiments, in which the time spent near a critical point is short.",

As the onset of collapse depends on the intensity of gravity, testing for sudden derivative changes and, if they are large, breaching the Seidov limit would reward with two successive discoveries: such a phase transition (which could stem from hadron matter but also from a gravitational phase transition), and a modification of General Relativity (thus breaking the matter/gravity degeneracy).

For an elliptically shaped interaction area, the hydrodynamic pressure gradient is greater along the minor axis, resulting in increased particle momentum in that direction - a phenomenon known as positive elliptic flow. In this paper, we demonstrate that in smaller systems, such as proton-proton and peripheral ion-ion collisions, microscopic models for final state interactions, can produce anisotropies where the elliptic flow is negative - that is, the momentum is largest along the major axis, contrary to hydrodynamic predictions. We present results from two distinct microscopic models: one based on repulsion between string-like fields and another based on effective kinetic theory. Negative elliptic flow is a solid prediction of the string interaction model while in the model based on kinetic theory it is linked to a finite interaction range. Consequently, an experimental determination of the sign of elliptic flow, will provide novel insights into the degrees of freedom governing strong nuclear interactions in high-energy collisions and the way in which they interact.",

This model generally assumes that the participating nucleons attain a thermal equilibrium characterized by the microcanonical ensemble before subsequent decays. However, from a theoretical viewpoint, it remains uncertain whether this assumption is universally valid. In this Letter, we critically examine this longstanding assumption through the lens of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), a cornerstone of the modern quantum thermalization theory. Utilizing the time-dependent configuration interaction shell model, it is found that, in certain cases, the long-time averages of nucleon occupation numbers can exhibit significant deviations from the microcanonical ensemble averages, in contrast to the conventional expectation. We attribute this discrepancy primarily to the violation of the ETH in the presence of isospin symmetry and discover that incorporating a substantial isospin-breaking term into the shell-model Hamiltonian can effectively restore the nucleon thermalization.",

In macroscopic approaches, it is expected that the large value of the relative orbital angular momentum, of the order of 100~$\\hbar$ is transferred through tangential dissipation to the fragments' intrinsic spin by sliding and rolling friction.   The goal is to investigate the angular momentum transfer from the initial relative orbital angular momentum to the fragments' spin. How is the transferred spin shared between the fragments? What is the time scale associated with the different mechanisms? How does deformation play a role?   A TDDFT simulation in the TDHF-Skyrme framework is used to describe several reactions at different impact parameters with increasing complexity. A method is proposed to study the evolution of the fragments' total spin as a function of time and angular velocity.   The increasingly complex reaction allows for careful analysis of all the mechanisms responsible for the transfer of spin. In particular, it is shown that the transfer of nucleons, and neck formation can significantly affect the transfer of spin through tangential friction.   Several mechanisms are in contradiction with previous macroscopic calculations. In particular, the spin of the fragments does not always increase during the collision which prevents it from being used to estimate the collision time of the reaction.",

All three states were produced directly in proton-induced fission on a uranium target, whereas only the isomeric states were populated in the $\\beta$ decay of the $^{114}$Ru ground state with spin-parity $0^+$. We propose spin-parity assignments of $(6^-)$ for the ground state, and $(3^+)$ and $(0^-)$ for the isomers. They resolve the puzzle of anomalous fission yields of this isotope despite the existing literature assigning a low angular momentum to the ground state. The experimental evidence is further supported by a detailed analysis based on mean-field calculations with the BSkG3 model. As for many other nuclei in this mass region, considering triaxial shapes is decisive for the interpretation of low-lying states of this nucleus.

Here, we present a Bayesian parameter inference for a fourth pulsar, PSR J1231-1411, using the same technique with NICER and XMM-Newton data. When applying a broad mass-inclination prior from radio timing measurements and the emission region geometry model that can best explain the data, we find likely-converged results only when using a limited radius prior. If limiting the radius to be consistent with the previous observational constraints and equation of state analyses, we infer the radius to be $12.6 \\pm 0.3$ km and the mass to be $1.04_{-0.03}^{+0.05}$ $M_\\odot$, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the $16\\,\\%$ and $84\\,\\%$ quantiles. If using an uninformative prior but limited between $10$ and $14$ km, we find otherwise similar results, but $R_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 13.5_{-0.5}^{+0.3}$ km for the radius. In both cases, we find a non-antipodal hot region geometry where one emitting spot is at the equator or slightly above, surrounded by a large colder region, and where a non-circular hot region lies close to southern rotational pole. If using a wider radius prior, we only find solutions that fit the data significantly worse. We discuss the challenges in finding the better fitting solutions, possibly related to the weak interpulse feature in the pulse profile.",

These results are computed using a convolved elastic and radiative energy loss model, which receives small system size corrections to both the elastic and radiative energy loss. We observe that suppression in small systems is almost entirely due to elastic energy loss; furthermore, we find that our model is acutely sensitive to the transition between hard thermal loop and vacuum propagators in the elastic energy loss.

    "title": "Effect of isoscalar and isovector scalar fields on baryon semileptonic decays in nuclear matter",
    "abstract": "The precise determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements is very important, because it could be a clue to new physics beyond Standard Theory. This is particular true of $V_{ud}$, because it is the main contribution to the unitary condition of the CKM matrix elements. The level of accuracy for the test of the unitarity involving the element $V_{ud}$ is now of the order of $10^{-4}$. Because the precise data for $V_{ud}$ is usually extracted from super-allowed nuclear $\\beta$ decay, it is quite significant to investigate the breaking of SU(3) flavor symmetry on the weak vector coupling constant in nuclear matter. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the isoscalar scalar ($\\sigma$) and the isovector scalar ($\\delta$ or $a_0$) mean-fields affect the weak vector and axial-vector coupling constants for semileptonic baryon (neutron, $\\Lambda$ or $\\Xi^-$) decay in asymmetric nuclear matter. To do so, we use the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, where nuclear matter consists of nucleons including quark degrees of freedom bound by the self-consistent exchange of scalar and vector mesons. We pay careful attention to the center of mass correction to the quark currents in matter. We then find that, for neutron $\\beta$ decay in asymmetric nuclear matter, the defect of the vector coupling constant due to the $\\delta$ field can be of the order of $10^{-4}$ at the nuclear saturation density, which is the same amount as the level of the current uncertainty in the measurements. It is also interesting that, in neutron-rich matter, there exists a certain low density at which isospin symmetry is restored, that is, the $u$-$d$ quark mass difference vanishes. We conclude that the effect of the isoscalar scalar and the isovector scalar fields should be considered in baryon semileptonic decays in nuclei.",

We find that anisotropic mountains may be detectable by current ground-based gravitational-wave detectors and might explain several observed phenomena, confirming the results of a previous work on less realistic neutron star models. In particular, we find that a slightly anisotropic neutron star crust that changes its rotation rate modestly can support an ellipticity of a few $\\times$ 10$^{-9}$, which is equivalent to the upper bounds on the ellipticity of some nearby and rapidlly spinning pulsars.",

We demonstrate that while the hydrodynamic modes remain unaffected by local field redefinition, the non-hydrodynamic modes are sensitive to it and can be eliminated through an appropriate all-order redefinition. This leads to a new hydro frame, where the spectrum contains only hydrodynamic modes. We further show that the resulting stress tensor may have an infinite series in momentum space, with a convergence radius linked to the eliminated non-hydrodynamic mode, illustrating its control over the validity of the hydrodynamic expansion. In certain special cases, higher-order terms in the stress tensor under field redefinition may cancel, indicating that non-hydrodynamic modes are mere artefacts of the fluid variable choice and hold no physical significance, even if they appear to violate physical constraints.",

This invalidates many assumptions involved in fitting data sets and determining the best fit values of power-law exponents.

    "abstract": "The energy-energy correlator is considered a powerful probe of jet substructure, especially a better probe of certain soft and collinear features, to study the utility of such observable for quark/gluon discrimination. This work first predicts the energy-energy correlators of inclusive jets in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{\\rm s}$ = 5.02 TeV for jet transverse momentum interval $40 - 60$ GeV. The Pb+Pb EEC distribution shifts to larger $R_{\\rm L}$ and smaller $R_{\\rm L}$. The shift toward larger $R_{\\rm L}$ is attributed to the energy loss effect when the jet evolves in the hot and dense medium and the shift toward smaller $R_{\\rm L}$ is due to the selection bias effects. Moreover, we find the EEC distribution for pure quark jets in A+A will only be suffering even stronger enhancement at $R_{\\rm L}> 0.2$, and the EEC distribution for pure gluon jets in A+A will be observed shifting toward smaller and larger $R_{\\rm L}$ at the same time. The jet quenching patterns (AA/pp) of the quark jets and the gluon jets can then be separated. We find that the differences are mainly determined by the initial EEC distribution in p+p, and are not affected much by the energy loss differences between quark and gluon. Inclusive jets are dominated by gluon jets, and photon-tagged jets are used to represent quark jets, we propose this double-ratio measurement to demonstrate the quark/gluon discrimination for the jet quenching phenomenon of jet substructures.",

The model parameters of the on QRPA model affect the predicted results of beta decay. The current study investigates the effect of nucleon nucleon pairing gaps on charge changing transitions and the associated beta decay rates. Three different values of pairing gaps, namely TF, 3TF and 5TF, were used in our investigation. It was concluded that both GT strength distributions and half lives are sensitive to pairing gap values. The 3TF pairing gap scheme, in our chosen nuclear model, resulted in best prediction with around 80 percent of the calculated half-lives within a factor 10 of the measured ones.

We perform a complete realistic simulation on medium modification of heavy and light flavor jet EEC in heavy-ion collisions. A clear flavor hierarchy is observed for jet EEC in both vacuum and QGP due to the mass effect. The medium modification of inclusive jet EEC at different angular scales exhibits very rich structure: suppression at intermediate angles, and enhancement at small and large angles, which can be well explained by the interplay of mass effect, energy loss, medium-induced radiation and medium response.

The initial production of heavy-flavor jets is carried out using the POWHEG+PYTHIA8 prescription, while the jet evolution in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is described by the SHELL transport model. In p+p collisions, we observe narrower angularity distributions for the D$^0$-tagged jets compared to inclusive jets, consistent with the preliminary ALICE results. We then demonstrate that jet quenching in the QGP may slightly widen the angularity distributions of both inclusive and D$^0$-tagged jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p at $10< p_{\\rm T,jet} < 20$ GeV/c. Additionally, by comparing the averaged angularities $\\langle \\lambda^{\\kappa}_{\\alpha} \\rangle$ of inclusive, D$^0$-tagged and B$^0$-tagged jets with varying $\\alpha$ and $\\kappa$, we show that the larger the quark mass is, the lower the jet's $\\langle \\lambda^{\\kappa}_{\\alpha} \\rangle$ values are.

For a larger jet radius, a more significant broadening of jet angularities could be obtained because of the enhanced contributions of the wide-angle particles. It is also noted that the angularity distributions of inclusive and D$^0$-tagged jets become narrower in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p at $p_{\\rm T,jet} > 20$ GeV/c due to the strong influence of the selection bias.",

It is found that the geometrical structures do not emerge for chiral phases transition, while the droplet, rod, slab, tube, and bubble phases emerge sequentially as density increases for the liquid-gas and deconfinement phase transitions. Additional attractive interactions between strange quark matter and hyperons are observed as the deconfinement phase transition is entangled with chiral phase transition of $s$ quarks.

By incorporating pairing correlations and deformation within DFT, nuclear masses can be predicted with sub-MeV accuracy. A crucial factor in achieving this precision is the dynamical correlation energy associated with restoring rotational symmetry, known as rotational correction energy (RCE). This correction is typically estimated using the cranking approximation in perturbation theory. In this work, we benchmark the results of these calculations against exact angular-momentum projection (AMP) for both even-even and odd-mass nuclei from light to heavy mass region, utilizing a covariant DFT framework. We find that the RCE, computed using the full moment of inertia (MoI) in the cranking approximation, closely matches the results from exact AMP for both even-even and odd-mass nuclei, with the exception of near-spherical even-even nuclei. For certain configurations in odd-mass nuclei, however, the RCEs can become abnormally small, a phenomenon linked to the divergence of the MoI. To address this, a regulator is introduced for the MoI of an odd-mass nucleus, the validity of which is examined through exact AMP calculations.",

    "title": "Effective nucleus-nucleus potentials for heavy-ion fusion reactions",
    "abstract": "Based on the Skyrme energy density functional and the reaction $Q$-value, we propose an effective nucleus-nucleus potential for describing the capture barrier in heavy-ion fusion processes. The 443 extracted barrier heights are well reproduced with a root-mean-square (rms) error of 1.53 MeV and the rms deviations with respect to 144 TDHF capture barrier heights is only 1.05 MeV. Together with the Siwek-Wilczy\\'{n}ski formula in which the three parameters are determined by the proposed effective potentials, the measured capture cross sections at energies around the barriers can be reasonably well reproduced for a series of fusion reactions induced by not only nearly spherical nuclei but also the nuclei with large deformations such as $^{154}$Sm and $^{238}$U. The shallow capture pockets and small values of the average barrier radii play a role in the reduction of the capture cross sections for $^{52,54}$Cr and $^{64}$Ni induced reactions which are related to the synthesis of new super-heavy nuclei.",

    "abstract": "In this paper the neutral 2SC phase of color superconductivity is investigated in the presence of a magnetic field and for diquark coupling constants and baryonic densities that are expected to characterize neutron stars. Specifically, the behavior of the charged gluons Meissner masses is investigated in the parameter region of interest taking into account in addition the contribution of a rotated magnetic field. It is found that up to moderately-high diquark coupling constants the mentioned Meissner masses become tachyonic independently of the applied magnetic field amplitude, hence signalizing the chromomagnetic instability of this phase. To remove the instability, it is proposed the restructuring of the system ground state, which now will be formed by vortices of the rotated charged gluons. These vortices boost the applied magnetic field having the most significant increase for relatively low applied magnetic fields. Finally, considering that with the stellar rotational frequency observed for magnetars a field of order $10^8$ G can be generated by dynamo effect. Then, we show that by the boosting effect just described the field can be amplified to $10^{17}$ G that is in the range of inner core fields expected for magnetars. Thus, we conclude that the described mechanism could be the one responsible for the large fields characterizing magnetars if the core of this compact objects are formed by neutral 2SC matter.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as a powerful tool for studying jet substructure, with promising applications such as probing the hadronization transition, analyzing the quark-gluon plasma, and improving the precision of top quark mass measurements. The projected $N$-point correlator measures correlations between $N$ final-state particles by tracking the largest separation between them, showing a scaling behavior related to DGLAP splitting functions. These correlators can be analytically continued in $N$, commonly referred to as $\\nu$-correlators, allowing access to non-integer moments of the splitting functions. Of particular interest is the $\\nu \\to 0$ limit, where the small momentum fraction behavior of the splitting functions requires resummation. Originally, the computational complexity of evaluating $\\nu$-correlators for $M$ particles scaled as $2^{2M}$, making it impractical for real-world analyses. However, by using recursion, we reduce this to $M 2^M$, and through the FastEEC method of dynamically resolving subjets, $M$ is replaced by the number of subjets. This breakthrough enables, for the first time, the computation of $\\nu$-correlators for LHC data. In practice, limiting the number of subjets to 16 is sufficient to achieve percent-level precision, which we validate using known integer-$\\nu$ results and convergence tests for non-integer $\\nu$. We have implemented this in an update to FastEEC and conducted an initial study of power-law scaling in the perturbative regime as a function of $\\nu$, using CMS Open Data on jets. The results agree with DGLAP evolution, except at small $\\nu$, where the anomalous dimension saturates to a value that matches the BFKL anomalous dimension. This work is meant as a first step towards detailed experimental measurements and precision theoretical studies.",

    "abstract": "The modifications imprinted on jets due to their interaction with Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) are assessed by comparing samples of jets produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions and proton-proton collisions. The standard procedure ignores the effect of bin migration by comparing specific observables for jet populations at the same reconstructed jet transverse momentum ($p_T$). Since jet $p_T$ is itself modified by interaction with QGP, all such comparisons confound QGP induced modifications with changes that are simply a consequence of comparing jets that started out differently. The quantile matching procedure introduced by Brewer et al. directly estimates average fractional jet energy loss ($Q_{AA}$) and can thus mitigate this $p_T$ migration effect. In this work, we validate the procedure in more realistic scenarios that include medium response. We study the evolution of $Q_{AA}$ with jet radius, its sensitivity to minimum particle $p_T$ and medium response as implemented in two different models for jet evolution in heavy-ion collisions. Further, we use this procedure to establish that the difference between inclusive jet and $\\gamma+$jet nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) is dominated by differences in the spectral shape, leaving the colour charge of the jet initiating parton with a lesser role to play. Additionally, we compare $Q_{AA}$ to an experimentally proposed proxy for fractional jet energy loss, $S_{loss}$, showing that both quantities are similar, although the former provides a more clear physical interpretation. Finally, we show the size of the $p_T$ migration correction for four different substructure observables and how to reliably use the quantile procedure experimentally to improve existing measurements.",

    "abstract": "We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system sizes $R$ and interaction strength $\\eta/s$ and identify universality classes based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\\hat \\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system size and $\\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and their response functions, along with the impact of the $\\eta/s$ and the system transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow $v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of large opacity.

At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density. This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These considerations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram where Quarkyonic Matter may be found.",

Valence-space nuclear shell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit registers using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24 qubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement ($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex nuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\\sim 8$ for some nuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell, dominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion. These results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.",

One such case is in the mass range of 160 for Dy, Er, Ho and Tm isotopes. In this work we attempt to constrain the Hauser-Feshbach model in the TALYS package by reproducing the available experimental data of $^{160}$Dy($p,\\gamma$)$^{161}$Ho and $^{162}$Er($p,\\gamma$)$^{163}$Tm in the $A\\sim 160$ mass region, and examine the effects of level density, gamma strength function and the optical model potential.

Our recommended rates differ from the JINA REACLIB by more than 1 order of magnitude in the temperature range of 2-3 GK. This results in the changes of final abundance of $p$-nuclei in the $A\\sim 160$ mass range by -5.5-3\\% from those with JINA, which means that the ($\\gamma$, $p$) reactions uncertainty is not predominant for the synthesis of these nuclei.",

We investigate the potential of constraining the EOS of quark stars (QSs) with high-precision measurements of mass $m$ and tidal deformability $\\Lambda$ from the XG GW observatories. We adopt the widely-used bag model for QSs, consisting of four microscopic parameters: the effective bag constant $B_{\\rm eff}$, the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter $a_4$, the strange quark mass $m_s$, and the pairing energy gap $\\Delta$. With the help of hierarchical Bayesian inference, for the first time we are able to infer the EOS of QSs combining multiple GW observations. Using the top 25 loudest GW events in our simulation, we find that, the constraints on $B_{\\rm eff}$ and $\\Delta$ are tightened by several times, while $a_4$ and $m_s$ are still poorly constrained. We also study a simplified 2-dimensional (2-d) EOS model which was recently proposed in literature.

With further work, this could lead to a near-elimination of detector backgrounds above about 6 MeV, which would significantly improve the sensitivity of Super-Kamiokande. These findings heighten the importance of adding gadolinium to Hyper-Kamiokande, which is at a shallower depth. Further, a similar approach could be used in other detectors, for example, the JUNO liquid-scintillator detector, which is also at a shallower depth.",

    "abstract": "The process of L\\'evy walk, i.e., movement patterns described by heavy-tailed random walks, play a role in many different phenomena, from chemical and microbiological systems through marine predators to climate change. Recent experiments have suggested that this phenomenon also appears in heavy-ion collisions. However, the theoretical background is not yet well understood. In high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei, the strongly interacting Quark Gluon Plasma is created, which, similarly to the early Universe, undergoes a rapid expansion and transition back to normal hadronic matter. In the subsequent expanding hadron gas, particles interact until kinetic freeze-out, when their momenta become fixed, and they freely transition toward the detectors. Measuring spatial freeze-out distributions is a crucial tool in understanding the dynamics of the created matter as well as the interactions among its constituents. In this paper, we present a novel three-dimensional analysis of the spatial freeze-out distribution of pions (the most abundant particles in such collisions). Utilizing Monte-Carlo simulations of high-energy collisions, we show that the chain of processes ending in a final state pion has a step length distribution leading to L\\'evy-stable distributions. Subsequently, we show that pion freeze-out distributions indeed exhibit heavy tails and can be described by a three-dimensional elliptically contoured symmetric L\\'evy-stable distribution.",

In case of hard proton knockout, the deviation of ISI/FSI from the 'standard' values may carry a signal of color transparency. In this regard, it is important to define the 'standard' as precisely as possible. This work continues previous studies within the framework of the Generalized Eikonal Approximation (GEA). The focus is on processes where the participating protons experience multiple soft rescattering on the spectator neutron. It is shown that correct treatment of deviations of the trajectories of outgoing protons from the longitudinal direction leads to a significant modification of partial amplitudes with soft rescattering of two outgoing protons and non-vanishing amplitudes with rescattering of incoming and outgoing protons. The new treatment of multiple rescattering is important in kinematics with a forward spectator neutron.",

Conventionally, $\\mu\\rightarrow e$ conversion experiments are optimized to detect electrons originating from transitions where the nucleus remains in the ground state, thereby maximizing the energy of the outgoing electron. Clearly, detection of a positive signal in forthcoming experiments would stimulate additional work $-$ including subsequent conversion experiments using complementary nuclear targets $-$ to further constrain the new physics responsible for CLFV. Here we argue that additional information can be extracted without the need for additional experiments, by considering inelastic conversion in $^{27}$Al. Transitions to low-lying nuclear excited states can modify the near-endpoint spectrum of conversion electrons, with the ratio of the elastic and inelastic responses being sensitive to the underlying CLFV operator. We extend the nuclear effective theory of $\\mu\\rightarrow e$ conversion to the inelastic case, which adds five new response functions to the six that arise for the elastic process. We evaluate these nuclear response functions in $^{27}$Al and calculate the resulting conversion-electron signal, taking into account the resolution anticipated in Mu2e/COMET.

On the one hand, there is the claim that there are no dynamic effects, and that the classic Salpeter correction based on static Debye screening is all that is needed for astrophysical applications. The size of the correction is on the order of 5% in typical solar fusion reactions. On the other hand, numerical simulations have shown that there is a dynamical effect, which essentially cancels the Salpeter correction. The results of the numerical simulations were later independently confirmed. The astrophysical community, however, has so far largely ignored the possibility of dynamical screening. The present paper is meant to serve as a reminder of the controversy. Not only does the claim of an absence of a dynamical effect equally warrant an independent confirmation, but there is motivation for further investigation, such as the assessment of current laboratory experiments and a quantitative study of the dynamical effect in case it will turn out to be real.",

Moreover, within the introduced framework, the Identity Method is easily extended to cope with arbitrarily higher-order moments. The techniques developed here offer significant potential for improving the accuracy of multiplicity distribution analyses in high-energy nuclear collisions.

    "abstract": "Based upon a combined formalism of Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), we propose a QCD kindred algebraic model for the dressed quark propagator, for the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude of the pion and the electromagnetic quark-photon interaction vertex. We then compute the $\\gamma^{*}\\pi^0\\gamma$ transition form factor $G^{\\gamma^{*}\\pi^0\\gamma}(Q^2)$ for a wide range of photon momentum transfer squared $Q^2$. The quark propagator is expanded out in its perturbative functional form but with dynamically generated dressed quark mass. It has complex conjugate pole singularities in the complex-momentum plane which is motivated by the solution of the quark gap equation with rainbow-ladder truncation of the infinite set of Schwinger-Dyson equations. This complex pole singularity structure of the quark propagator can be associated with a signal of confinement which prevents quarks to become stable asymptotic states. The Bethe-Salpeter amplitude is expressed without a spectral density function, which encapsulate its low and large momentum behaviour. The QCD evolution of the distribution amplitude is also incorporated into our model through the direct implementation of Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage evolution equations. We include the effects of the quark anomalous magnetic moment in the description of the quark-photon vertex whose infrared enhancement is known to dictate hadronic properties. Once the QCD kindred model is constructed, we calculate the form factor $G^{\\gamma^{*}\\pi^0\\gamma}(Q^2)$ and find it consistent with direct QCD-based studies as well as most available experimental data. It slightly exceeds the conformal limit for large $Q^2$ which might be attributed to the scaling violations in QCD.

We present the first microscopic calculations of $^3$He$(\\alpha,\\gamma)^7$Be with explicit inclusion of three-nucleon forces. Our prediction of the astrophysical $S$ factor qualitatively agrees with experimental data. We further incorporate experimental bound-state and scattering information in our calculation to arrive at a more quantitative description.

In these environments, matter can reach high temperatures of tens of MeVs and be subject to large magnetic fields. We thus investigate Urca rates at different temperatures and field strengths by performing the full temperature and magnetic-field dependent rate integrals for different equations of state. We find that the magnetic fields play an important role at temperatures of a few MeV, especially close to or below the direct Urca threshold, which is softened by the magnetic field. At higher temperatures, the effect of the magnetic fields can be overshadowed by the thermal effects. We observe that the magnetic field more strongly influences the neutron decay rates than the electron capture rates, leading to a shift in chemical equilibrium.",

It is, however, replaced in a region with higher density and/or magnetic field by the so-called domain-wall Skyrmion(DWSk) phase where Skyrmions are created on top of the CSL. This was previously proposed within the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) approximation neglecting a gauge field dynamics and taking into account its effect by a flux quantization condition. In this paper, by taking into account dynamics of the gauge field, we show that the phase boundary between the CSL and DWSk phases beyond the BPS approximation is identical to the one obtained in the BPS approximation. We also find that domain-wall Skyrmions are electrically charged with the charge one as a result of the chiral anomaly.",

    "abstract": "The energy and centrality dependence of the kaon resonance ratio $(K^{*0}+\\Bar{K}^{*0})/(K^+ + K^-)$ is explored in the RHIC-BES and CBM-FAIR energy regime. To this aim, the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model is employed to simulate reconstructable $K^{*}$ resonances in Au+Au and p+p collisions from $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}=3-39$ GeV. We obtain a good description of the resonance yields and mean transverse momenta over the whole investigated energy range. The decrease of the $K^*/K$ ratio, with increasing centrality is in line with the available experimental data. We also observe the experimenatlly measured increase in $\\langle p_{\\text{T}}\\rangle$ with increasing centrality which is interpreted as a lower reconstruction probability of low-$p_{\\text{T}}$ $K^*$ due to the $p_{\\text{T}}$ dependent absorption of the decay daughter hadrons. We conclude that the observed suppression of reconstructable $K^{*}$ resonances provides a strong sign of an extended hadronic rescattering stage at all investigated energies. Its duration increases from peripheral to central reactions as expected. Following a method, suggested by the STAR experiment, the \"duration\" of the hadronic stage is extracted using the $K^*/K$ ratios at chemical and kinetic freeze-out. The resulting lifetimes are in good agreement with the experimental data, but much shorter than the actual lifetime of the hadronic phase in the transport simulation. This indicates that the experimental method to estimate the life time of the hadronic stage is too simplified.",

Two potential models were used in the analysis of the measured $(d,d)$ and $(d,d')$ data within the optical model and the distorted-wave Born approximation: the phenomenological optical model potential associated with the collective model of nuclear scattering, and the semi-microscopic double-folding model of the deuteron-nucleus potential based on a realistic density-dependent M3Y interaction.

We extend our recent DNO-SM approach within the \\textit{Variation-After-Projection} (VAP) scheme, dubbed as DNO-SM(VAP). This approach naturally enables to \\textit{a priori} capture correlations more efficiently than the \\textit{Projection-After-Variation} (PAV) scheme which is commonly used in current theoretical modelings of nuclei. Using the Kuo-Herling effective interaction, we first examine the extended method by a systematic comparison of the binding energies, the \\textit{yrast} spectra and electromagnetic moments of some representative nuclei of masses ranging from $A=251$ to $A=256$. The results show that the VAP scheme variationally provides more bound solutions with respect to the PAV scheme, reflecting the additional correlations that were captured. Both spectra, dipole and spectroscopic quadrupole moments are reproduced favorably. We then focus on the case of $^{254}$No, one of the most studied elements experimentally, which can be considered as the portal to the superheavy region. The calculations show a striking agreement with the complete experimentally known spectroscopy: the \\textit{yrast} band, isomers and associated $K$ bands, and the newly observed 0$^+$ and ($K=4$) 4$^+$ states, providing for the first time the complete shell-model description of $^{254}$No. The present successful achievement opens a new way for forthcoming spectroscopic studies of heavy and superheavy nuclei.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high-$T_\\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.",

In this paper, we investigate the consequences of projective algebras formed by non-invertible symmetries and lattice translations in a generalized $1+1$D quantum XY model based on group-valued qudits. This model is specified by a finite group $G$ and enjoys a projective $\\mathsf{Rep}(G)\\times Z(G)$ and translation symmetry, where symmetry operators obey a projective algebra in the presence of symmetry defects. For invertible symmetries, such projective algebras imply Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies. However, this is not generally true for non-invertible symmetries, and we derive a condition on $G$ for the existence of an LSM anomaly. When this condition is not met, we prove that any unique and gapped ground state is necessarily a non-invertible weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) state with non-trivial entanglement, for which we construct an example fixed-point Hamiltonian. The projectivity also affects the dual symmetries after gauging $\\mathsf{Rep}(G)\\times Z(G)$ sub-symmetries, giving rise to non-Abelian and non-invertible dipole symmetries, as well as non-invertible translations. We complement our analysis with the SymTFT, where the projectivity causes it to be a topological order non-trivially enriched by translations.

Molecules are more challenging to cool than atoms due to their vibrational and rotational internal degrees of freedom. Molecular rotations lead to the use of type-II transitions ($F \\geq F'$) for magneto-optical trapping (MOT). When typical red detuned light frequencies are applied to these transitions, sub-Doppler heating is induced, resulting in higher temperatures and larger molecular cloud sizes than realized with the type-I MOTs most often used with atoms. To improve type-II MOTs, Jarvis et al. PRL 120, 083201 (2018) proposed a blue-detuned MOT to be applied after initial cooling and capture with a red-detuned MOT. This was successfully implemented (Burau et al. PRL 130, 193401 (2023), Jorapur et al. PRL 132, 163403 (2024), Li et al. PRL 132, 233402 (2024)), realizing colder and denser molecular samples. Very recently, Hallas et al. arXiv:2404.03636 (2024) demonstrated a blue-detuned MOT with a \"1+2\" configuration that resulted in even stronger compression of the molecular cloud.

They are uniquely and efficiently described by their correlation matrix. However, in practical experiments, the correlation matrix can only be estimated with finite accuracy. This raises the question: how does the error in estimating the correlation matrix affect the trace-distance error of the state? We show that if the correlation matrix is known with an error $\\varepsilon$, the trace-distance error also scales as $\\varepsilon$ (and vice versa). Specifically, we provide distance bounds between (both pure and mixed) free-fermionic states in relation to their correlation matrix distance. Our analysis also extends to cases where one state may not be free-fermionic. Importantly, we leverage our preceding results to derive significant advancements in property testing and tomography of free-fermionic states. Property testing involves determining whether an unknown state is close to or far from being a free-fermionic state. We first demonstrate that any algorithm capable of testing arbitrary (possibly mixed) free-fermionic states would inevitably be inefficient. Then, we present an efficient algorithm for testing low-rank free-fermionic states. For free-fermionic state tomography, we provide improved bounds on sample complexity in the pure-state scenario, substantially improving over previous literature, and we generalize the efficient algorithm to mixed states, discussing its noise-robustness.",

Inductive measurements with the detection based on a two-photon interaction in rf atomic magnetometers address some of these issues, as the sensor gains an uplift in its operational frequency. The developments reported here integrate the fundamental and applied aspects of the two-photon process in magnetic induction measurements.

A method for the retrieval of the two-photon phase information, which is critical for inductive measurements, is also demonstrated.

This well applies to the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, where quantum algorithms and quantum processors both need to be shaped to allow for advantages in experimental implementations. The state-of-the-art quantum adiabatic optimization algorithm faces challenges for scaling up, where the deteriorating optimization performance is not necessarily alleviated by increasing the circuit depth given the noise in the hardware. The counterdiabatic term can be introduced to accelerate the convergence, but decomposing the unitary operator corresponding to the counterdiabatic terms into one and two-qubit gates may add additional burden to the digital circuit depth. In this work, we focus on the counterdiabatic protocol with a codesigned approach to implement this algorithm on a photonic quantum processor. The tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometer mesh provides rich programmable parameters for local and global manipulation, making it able to perform arbitrary unitary evolutions. Accordingly, we directly implement the unitary operation associated to the counterdiabatic quantum optimization on our processor without prior digitization. Furthermore, we develop and implement an optimized counterdiabatic method by tackling the higher-order many-body interaction terms. Moreover, we benchmark the performance in the case of factorization, by comparing the final success probability and the convergence speed.

Our central result is the extension of Nielsen's Theorem to arbitrary factors. As in the matrix algebra case, the LOCC ordering of bipartite pure states is connected to the majorization of their restrictions. Our theorem implies that, in a bipartite system modeled by commuting factors in Haag duality, a) all states have infinite one-shot entanglement if and only if the local factors are not of type I, b) type III factors are characterized by LOCC transitions of arbitrary precision between any two pure states, and c) the latter holds even without classical communication for type III$_{1}$ factors. In the case of semifinite factors, the usual construction of entanglement monotones carries over using majorization theory. In the appendix, we provide a self-contained treatment of majorization on semifinite von Neumann algebras and $\\sigma$-finite measure spaces.",

Additionally, we critically assess the impact of finite measurement resources and noise on the reservoir's dynamics in different regimes, quantifying the limited ability to exploit quantum effects for increasing damping and noise strengths.

    "abstract": "Nuclear magnetism underpins areas such as medicine in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hyperpolarization of nuclei enhances the quantity and quality of information that can be determined from these techniques by increasing their signal to noise ratios by orders of magnitude. However, some of these hyperpolarization techniques rely on the use of low to ultralow magnetic fields (ULF) (nTs-mTs), where empirical data on how nuclear magnetism behaves is lacking. The broadband character and ultrasensitive field sensitivity of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) allow for probing nuclear magnetism at these fields, where other magnetometers, such as Faraday coils and flux gates do not. To this end, we designed a hyperpolarization reactor to hyperpolarize [1-$^{13}$C]pyruvate with the technique, signal amplification by reversible exchange in shield enables alignment transfer to heteronuclei (SABRE-SHEATH). Afterwards, we were able to characterize the field sensitivity of our setup by simulating the filled reactor in relation to its placement in our ultralow noise, ULF MRI setup. Using the results of the simulations, we determined that our hyperpolarization setup results in a $^{13}$C polarization of 0.4%, a signal enhancement of ~100 000 000 versus the predicted thermal equilibrium signal at earth field (~50 $\\mu$T). This results in a $^{13}$C signal of 7.44$\\pm$0.91 pT, which with our ultralow noise setup, opens the possibility for the first direct detection of nuclear magnetism without system perturbation.",

Most of the techniques for effecting a nanoMRI gradient use small permanent magnets. Here, we present a switchable magnetic field gradient on a tip, which is designed to provide a local and controllable magnetic field with a high gradient on the nanometer scale. We incorporate the gradient field with a nanoscale magnetic resonance sensor, a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, to provide high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. The device is a metal microwire deposited along a quartz tip, with the current flowing along the tip inducing a magnetic field around its apex. This field can be manipulated throughout a measurement by controlling the current along the wire. We achieved gradients as high as 1 $\\mathrm{\\mu}\\text{T/nm}$ at fields weaker than 200 $\\mathrm{\\mu}\\text{T}$. Such a gradient can facilitate electron spin mapping with 1 nm resolution using single NV sensors, allowing for nanoscale imaging of electrons. The ability to switch the current on and off and to position the device with high precision overcomes limitations such as limited emitter contrast and the flexibility in sample preparation. Moreover, we show that proximity of the metallic tip to the sensor modifies the Rabi power in a spatially dependent manner, providing regions with enhanced ($\\times$3.5) and decreased Rabi power. This spatial gradient, induced by the tip, offers the opportunity for selective pulses on nearby spin species where the same microwave power will result in different spin manipulation characteristics.",

We estimate the infidelity of cultivation (from injection to idling at distance 15) using a mix of state vector simulation, stabilizer simulation, error enumeration, and Monte Carlo sampling. Compared to prior work, cultivation uses an order of magnitude fewer qubit-rounds to reach logical error rates as low as $2 \\cdot 10^{-9}$ when subjected to $10^{-3}$ uniform depolarizing circuit noise. Halving the circuit noise to $5 \\cdot 10^{-4}$ improves the achievable logical error rate to $4 \\cdot 10^{-11}$.

Since modern AI systems are often built on neural networks, the design of quantum neural networks becomes a key challenge in integrating quantum computing into AI. To provide a more fine-grained characterisation of the impact of quantum components on the performance of neural networks, we propose a framework where classical neural network layers are gradually replaced by quantum layers that have the same type of input and output while keeping the flow of information between layers unchanged, different from most current research in quantum neural network, which favours an end-to-end quantum model. We start with a simple three-layer classical neural network without any normalisation layers or activation functions, and gradually change the classical layers to the corresponding quantum versions. We conduct numerical experiments on image classification datasets such as the MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets to demonstrate the change of performance brought by the systematic introduction of quantum components. Through this framework, our research sheds new light on the design of future quantum neural network models where it could be more favourable to search for methods and frameworks that harness the advantages from both the classical and quantum worlds.",

Perfect quantum oblivious transfer with information theoretic security is known to be impossible. We aim to find the lowest possible cheating probabilities. Bounds on cheating probabilities have been investigated for complete protocols, where if both parties follow the protocol, the bit value obtained by the receiver matches the sender bit value. We instead investigate incomplete protocols, where the receiver obtains an incorrect bit value with probability pf. We present optimal non interactive protocols where Alice bit values are encoded in four symmetric pure quantum states, and where she cannot cheat better than with a random guess. We find the protocols such that for a given pf, Bob cheating probability pr is as low as possible, and vice versa.

To address these challenges, we investigate the optical nonreciprocity of the 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) superradiance lattices in room-temperature atoms. The probe fields propagating in two opposite directions perceive two different SSH topological phases, which have different absorption spectra due to the interplay between the Zak phase and the thermal motion of atoms, resulting in optical nonreciprocity.

Previous demonstrations of transmitting entangled photons over long distance using satellites or fibers have use entangled photon pairs generated from bulk crystal arrangements. An alternative approach would be to generate photon pairs using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) chips. Despite numerous proof-of-concept studies, no long range distribution has been achieved using this platform because of the challenge of getting sufficient off-chip brightness. We report a SOI platform that provides an off-chip entangled photon pair brightness of between 8,000 to 460,000 pairs per second. This exceeds previous reports by three orders of magnitude in brightness. The entanglement fidelity is 99.85(6)% and 97.90(3)% respectively. Measuring one photon locally, and transmitting the other over 93 km of deployed fiber (link loss of 40 dB), achieves a count rate of 132 pairs per second with an entanglement fidelity of 93.3(3)%, after solving the additional challenges of chromatic dispersion. The source can be pumped harder to enable transmission of entangled photons over 155 km of deployed fiber (link loss of 66 dB) at a rate of 0.7 pairs per second, with an entanglement fidelity of 87.6(5)%.

    "abstract": "Cat qubits, a type of bosonic qubit encoded in a harmonic oscillator, can exhibit an exponential noise bias against bit-flip errors with increasing mean photon number. Here, we focus on cat qubits stabilized by two-photon dissipation, where pairs of photons are added and removed from a harmonic oscillator by an auxiliary, lossy buffer mode. This process requires a large loss rate and strong nonlinearities of the buffer mode that must not degrade the coherence and linearity of the oscillator. In this work, we show how to overcome this challenge by coloring the loss environment of the buffer mode with a multi-pole filter and optimizing the circuit to take into account additional inductances in the buffer mode. Using these techniques, we achieve near-ideal enhancement of cat-qubit bit-flip times with increasing photon number, reaching over $0.1$ seconds with a mean photon number of only $4$. Concurrently, our cat qubit remains highly phase coherent, with phase-flip times corresponding to an effective lifetime of $T_{1,\\text{eff}} \\simeq 70$ $\\mu$s, comparable with the bare oscillator lifetime. We achieve this performance even in the presence of an ancilla transmon, used for reading out the cat qubit states, by engineering a tunable oscillator-ancilla dispersive coupling. Furthermore, the low nonlinearity of the harmonic oscillator mode allows us to perform pulsed cat-qubit stabilization, an important control primitive, where the stabilization can remain off for a significant fraction (e.g., two thirds) of a $3~\\mathrm{\\mu s}$ cycle without degrading bit-flip times. These advances are important for the realization of scalable error-correction with cat qubits, where large noise bias and low phase-flip error rate enable the use of hardware-efficient outer error-correcting codes.",

In the semiclassical limit, such calculations are governed by Euclidean (or, more generally, complex) saddle-point geometries. We emphasize here that, at least in simple contexts, the Euclidean approach suggests an alternative formulation in terms of the bulk quantum wavefunction. Since this alternate formulation can be directly applied to the real-time quantum theory, it is insensitive to subtleties involved in defining the Euclidean path integral. In particular, it can be consistent with many different choices of integration contour.   Despite the fact that self-adjoint operators in the associated real-time quantum theory have real eigenvalues, we note that the bulk wavefunction encodes the Euclidean (or complex) R\\'enyi geometries that would arise in any Euclidean path integral. As a result, for any given quantum state, the appropriate real-time path integral yields both R\\'enyi entropies and associated complex saddle-point geometries that agree with Euclidean methods. After brief explanations of these general points, we use JT gravity to illustrate the associated real-time computations in detail.",

    "abstract": "Entanglement in a many-particle system can enable measurement sensitivities beyond that achievable by only classical correlations. For an ensemble of spins, all-to-all interactions are known to reshape the quantum projection noise, leading to a form of entanglement known as spin squeezing. Here, we demonstrate spin squeezing with strictly short-range contact interactions. In particular, working with ultracold lithium atoms in optical lattices, we utilize superexchange interactions to realize a nearest-neighbor anisotropic Heisenberg model. We investigate the resulting quench dynamics from an initial product state in both one and three dimensions. In 1D, we observe $1.9^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$ dB of spin squeezing in quantitative agreement with theory. However, in 3D, we observe a maximum of $2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$ dB of squeezing, over an order of magnitude smaller than that expected. We demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from the presence of a finite density of holes; both the motion of the holes as well as direct coupling between spin and density qualitatively alter the spin dynamics. Our observations point to the importance of understanding the complex interplay between motional and spin degrees of freedom in quantum simulators.",

However, experimental efforts to explore similar physics in condensed matter typically employ bosonic matter modes (e.g., phonons, magnons, and plasmons) that are describable as simple harmonic oscillators, i.e., an infinite ladder of equally spaced energy levels. Here, we examine ultrastrong coupling between a coherent light mode and an ensemble of paramagnetic spins, a finite-multilevel system, in Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$. The electron paramagnetic resonance of Gd$^{3+}$ ions is tuned by a magnetic field into resonance with a Fabry--P\\'erot cavity mode, resulting in the formation of spin--photon hybrid states, or Zeeman polaritons. We observe that the light--matter coupling strength, measured through the vacuum Rabi splitting, decreases with increasing temperature, which can be explained by the temperature-dependent population difference between the lower and higher-energy states, a trait of a finite-level system. This finding demonstrates that a spin--boson system is more compatible with the Dicke model and has advantages over boson--boson systems for pursuing experimental realizations of phenomena predicted for ultrastrongly coupled light--matter hybrids.",

After the formulation of the Bell inequalities, violated by quantum physics, it is nowadays believed that the theory is complete and non-local. While more general Bell-like inequalities, such as the one of Clauser and Horne, envisage a situation in which two parties choose at random two measurements to perform at causally-disconnected space-times, one could formulate temporal inequalities in which the two parties measure at different times. However, for causally-connected parties, these extensions are compatible with local hidden-variable theories, so that no quantum nature appears in such temporal correlations. Here we show that a temporal Clauser-Horne inequality for two spins is violated for nonzero time interval between the measurements if the two measured parties are connected by a spin chain. The chain constitutes a medium for the spreading of quantum information, which prevents the immediate signaling and thus the deterministic time evolution after the first measurement. Our result suggests that, as expected in a many-body setup, the Lieb-Robinson bound substitutes the speed of light as the fundamental limit for the spreading of information.",

A hydrodynamical picture for operator spreading allows us to argue that, for random unitary circuits, $\\overline{g}$ is encoded by the leading eigenvalue of a dynamical map obtained by enriching unitary dynamics with dissipation, in the limit of weak dissipation. We argue that the size of the eigenvalue does not depend on the details of this weak dissipation (given mild assumptions on properties of the ergodic dynamics), so long as it only suppresses large operators significantly. Our calculations are based on analytical results for random unitary circuits, but we argue that similar results hold for ergodic Floquet systems.

In particular, ballistic growth is impossible for $\\alpha < 1$, diffusive growth is impossible for $\\alpha < 1/2$, and any finite dynamical exponent becomes impossible for sufficiently small $\\alpha$.

In particular, we show numerically that the entanglement entropy curves in this disordered phase follow the expected scaling of a conformal field theory (CFT) in the continuum limit. This property is shown to be non-generic for other types of quasiperiodic disorder, only appearing when our boundary disorder ansatz is described by a \"dual\" bulk hyperbolic tiling.

For confined excitations, the magnetic field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, while for strong confinement transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen. In addition, we demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated.

Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and outof-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.",

A unitary spherical $n$-category is mathematically defined and emerges as the local quantum symmetry of the lattice model. The alterfold construction unifies various constructions of $n+1$ TQFT from $n$-dimensional lattice models and $n$-categories. In particular, we construct a non-invertible unitary 3+1 alterfold TQFT from a linear functional and derive its local quantum symmetry as a unitary spherical 3-category of Ising type with explicit 20j-symbols, so that the scalar invariant of 2-knots in piecewise linear 4-manifolds could be computed explicitly.",

When using depolarized GHZ states as the probe, we derive a closed-form fidelity threshold to achieve advantage over the optimal local sensing strategy. The threshold indicates that while entanglement is needed for this quantum advantage, genuine multipartite entanglement is generally unnecessary. We further explore the impacts from imperfect local entanglement generation and local measurement constraint, and our results imply that the quantum advantage is more robust against quantum network imperfections than local operation errors. Finally, we demonstrate that the quantum advantage in distributed sensing can be achieved with a three-node quantum network using practical protocol stacks through simulations with SeQUeNCe, an open-source, customizable quantum network simulator.",

The security proof of DIQKD is derived from the violation of a Bell inequality, mitigating side-channel attacks by asserting the presence of nonlocality. This enhanced security comes at the cost of a challenging implementation, especially over long distances, as losses make Bell tests difficult to conduct successfully. Here, we propose a photonic realization of DIQKD, utilizing a heralded preparation of a single-photon path entangled state between the honest users. Being based on single-photon interference effects, the obtained secret key rate scales with the square root of the quantum channel transmittance. This leads to positive key rates over distances of up to hundreds of kilometers, making the proposed setup a promising candidate for securing long-distance communication in quantum networks.",

In a seminal work by Wolf et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 150402 (2008)], it was shown that deciding whether a given quantum channel was generated from an underlying effective Markovian dynamics, with time-independent Lindbladian generator, is generally an NP-hard problem. In this work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced dynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly facilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet theory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion is minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate for an effective Lindblad generator, hence significantly reducing the complexity of the search for an effective Lindblad generator in many (though not all) cases. Our results are relevant for engineering Floquet Lindbladians in complex many-body systems.",

Statements which are fundamentally untestable are hypotheses which belong to metaphysics. Such are all interpretations of quantum mechanics, which attribute to its mathematical tools meanings that are beyond experimentally observable events, while not affecting quantum predictions of these events.   We show that \"unitary quantum mechanics\", which according to its followers leads to some interesting paradoxes, is an interpretation of quantum mechanics, based on hypotheses that are untestable. The (operational) quantum mechanics, which is the one tested in every quantum experiment is free of these paradoxes.   The root of \"unitary\" vs. operational discrepancy is that the latter treats the measurement process as irreversible, and in the different answers to the question of what is described by the state vector.   The clearest manifestation of this is the insistence of the supporters of \"unitary quantum mechanics\" that measurements can be \"in principle undone\". \"Unitarists\" also try to avoid the postmeasurement state vector collapse at any cost, including no attempt to describe it, but still accept the Born rule as a calculational tool.   Ipso facto, the hypothesis of \"in principle possibility of undoing measurements\" belongs to metaphysics, as it is untestable. In the case of predictions of factual events in the laboratories the ``unitary\" quantum mechanics agrees with the operational one. It shares this property with all interpretations of quantum mechanics which do not affect its predictions. Metaphysics begins when one requests that quantum mechanics should be more than a mathematically formulated theory which predicts future observable events of a certain class basing on events observed earlier (of the same class).",

Here we present an alternative, {\\it dual} formulation, where we instead calculate the static susceptibility of an observable, which then gives us the linear response in the expectation values for any number of different Hamiltonian perturbations. We show how the calculation of the susceptibility can be performed with the same expansion schemes used in recursive density matrix perturbation theory, including generalizations to fractional occupation numbers and self-consistent linear response calculations, i.e. similar to density functional perturbation theory. As with recursive density matrix perturbation theory, the dual susceptibility formulation is well suited for numerically thresholded sparse matrix algebra, which has linear scaling complexity for sufficiently large sparse systems. Similarly, the recursive computation of the susceptibility also seamlessly integrates with the computational framework of deep neural networks used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications.

Employing a space-time graph model to represent the network's temporal evolution, we propose an entanglement distribution strategy based on path utility, incorporating pointing errors, non-ideal link transmittance for intersatellite links, and atmospheric effects for downlinks. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in reducing entanglement drop rates and improving throughput compared to conventional methods.

Research in representation theory indicates that combining symbolic-mathematical elements (e.g. formulae) with visual-graphical representations enhances conceptual understanding more effectively than representations that merely depict phenomena. However, common representations vary widely, and existing categorisation systems do not adequately distinguish between them in QP. To address this, we developed a new set of differentiation criteria based on insights from representation research, QP education, and specific aspects of the quantum sciences. We created a comprehensive category system for evaluating visual QP representations for educational use, grounded in Ainsworths (2006) DeFT Framework. Twenty-one experts from four countries evaluated this category system using four qubit representations: the Bloch sphere, Circle Notation, Quantum Bead, and the pie chart (Qake) model. This evaluation enabled us to assess the discriminative power of our criteria and the effectiveness of each representation in supporting the learning of QP concepts. It evaluated how well each representation conveyed quantum concepts such as quantum state, measurement, superposition, entanglement, and quantum technologies (X-, Z-, and H-gates) across 16 criteria. The results showed significant differences in the effectiveness of these representations, particularly in conveying key concepts like superposition and measurement. Additionally, expert ratings indicated notable variations in the potential of each representation to induce misconceptions, linked to differences in shape, measurement behaviour, and requirements for understanding entanglement. We also discuss considerations for developing new representations and suggest directions for future empirical studies.",

Across different setups, we can see a vast number of different approaches used to analyze these images. Often, the choice of detection algorithm is either not mentioned at all or it is not justified. We investigate several different algorithms and compare their performance in terms of both precision and execution run time. To do so, we rely on a set of synthetic images across different simulated exposure times with known occupancy states. Since the use of simulation provides us with the ground truth of atom site occupancy, we can easily state precise error rates and variances of the reconstructed property. To also rule out the possibility of better algorithms existing, we calculated the Cram\\'er-Rao bound in order to establish an upper limit that even a perfect estimator cannot outperform. As the metric of choice, we used the number of photonelectrons that can be contributed to a specific atom site. Since the bound depends on the occupancy of neighboring sites, we provide the best and worst cases, as well as a half filled one. Our comparison shows that of our tested algorithms, a global non-linear least-squares solver that uses the optical system's PSF to return a each sites' number of photoelectrons performed the best, on average crossing the worst-case bound for longer exposure times. Its main drawback is its huge computational complexity and, thus, required calculation time. We manage to somewhat reduce this problem, suggesting that its use may be viable.

The effect of an external perpendicular magnetic field is incorporated into the contacts via Peierls substitution. We observe a transition from a gapped phase to a flat band regime at zero energy by varying the magnetic field. This transition is characterized by the emergence of highly localized states in the bulk or edges, which we observe by calculating local density-of-states (LDOS). We analyze transport in the system along two directions ($x$ and $y$) via transmission measurements, indicating a magnetic field-induced transition from insulating to metallic phase. The study of the energy spectrum of the system shows the formation of Landau levels. Moreover, the quantum number of the non-degenerate and degenerate Landau levels (transmission modes) can be any integer or only an odd integer, depending on diagonal, inter-cell, and intra-cell hopping strengths. From the analysis of the transport properties along $y$-direction, we find that edge modes play a crucial role in facilitating ballistic transport.",

    "abstract": "The realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing requires the execution of quantum error-correction (QEC) schemes, to mitigate the fragile nature of qubits. In this context, to ensure the success of QEC, a protocol capable of implementing both qubit reset and leakage reduction is highly desirable. We demonstrate such a protocol in an architecture consisting of fixed-frequency transmon qubits pair-wise coupled via tunable couplers -- an architecture that is compatible with the surface code. We use tunable couplers to transfer any undesired qubit excitation to the readout resonator of the qubit, from which this excitation decays into the feedline. In total, the combination of qubit reset, leakage reduction, and coupler reset takes only 83ns to complete. Our reset scheme is fast, unconditional, and achieves fidelities well above 99%, thus enabling fixed-frequency qubit architectures as future implementations of fault-tolerant quantum computers. Our protocol also provides a means to both reduce QEC cycle runtime and improve algorithmic fidelity on quantum computers.",

    "abstract": "Spatially modulated symmetries have emerged since the discovery of fractons, which characterize unconventional topological phases with mobility-constrained quasiparticle excitations. On the other hand, non-invertible duality defects have attracted substantial attention in communities of high energy and condensed matter physics due to their deep insight into quantum anomalies and exotic phases of matter. However, the connection between these exotic symmetries and defects has not been fully explored. In this paper, we construct concrete lattice models with non-invertible duality defects via gauging spatially modulated symmetries and investigate their exotic fusion rules. Specifically, we construct spin models with subsystem symmetries or dipole symmetries on one, two, and three-dimensional lattices. Gauging subsystem symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects whose fusion rules involve $0$-form subsystem charges in two dimensions and higher-form operators that correspond to ``lineon'' excitations (excitations which are mobile along one-dimensional line) in three dimensions. Gauging dipole symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects with dipole algebras that describe a hierarchical structure between global and dipole charges. Notably, the hierarchical structure of the dual dipole charges is inverted compared with the original ones. Our work provides a unified and systematic analytical framework for constructing exotic duality defects by gauging relevant symmetries.",

    "abstract": "In quantum field theories that admit gravity dual, specific inequalities involving entanglement entropy between arbitrary disjoint spatial regions hold. An example is the negativity of tripartite information. Inspired by this, we investigate the analogous entropy inequalities in Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and sparse SYK models, which involve the entanglement among different flavors of Majorana fermions rather than spatial entanglement. Sparse SYK models are models where some of the SYK couplings are set to zero. Since these models have been argued to admit gravity duals up to a certain sparseness, it is interesting to see whether the multipartite entanglement structure changes in a sparseness-dependent manner. In the parameter space explored by our numerical analysis, which we performed upto five parties, we find that all entropy inequalities are satisfied for any temperature and degree of sparseness for an arbitrary choice of flavor subregions. In addition, if we plot the multipartite entanglement entropy in terms of purity, the only significant effect of sparseness is to change the range of purity. Thus, we conclude that multipartite information is almost unaffected by sparseness. As a counterexample, we also show that in a vector model of $N$-flavored Majorana fermions which contains no random variables, choices of subregions exist for which the entropy inequalities are violated.",

Studies have shown that the empirical error is usually much smaller than the one suggested by existing bounds, implying the actual circuit cost required is much less than the ones based on those bounds. Here, we improve the estimate of the Trotter error over existing bounds, by introducing a general framework of commutant decomposition that separates disjoint error components that have fundamentally different scaling with time. In particular we identify two error components that each scale as $\\mathcal{O}(t^{p+1}/r^p)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(t^p/r^p)$ for a $p$th-order product formula evolving to time $t$ using $r$ partitions. Under a fixed step size $t/r$, it implies one would scale linearly with time $t$ and the other would be constant of $t$. We show that this formalism not only straightforwardly reproduces previous results but also provides a better error estimate for higher-order product formulas. We demonstrate the improvement both analytically and numerically. We also apply the analysis to observable error relating to the heating in Floquet dynamics and thermalization, which is of independent interest.",

However, photon losses in quantum channels remain a significant challenge, limiting the distance and capacity of entanglement distributions. This study suggests three heralded schemes that distribute multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states via lossy quantum channels. These schemes utilize different photon sources (Bell states or single-photons) and channel structures (centralized or decentralized heralding detectors). By comparing success probabilities and heralding efficiency, we find that each scheme has its own advantage according to the number of parties and the channel distance and the security requirement.

    "abstract": "A fundamental idea in wave mechanics is that propagation in a periodic medium can be described by Bloch waves whose conserved crystal momenta define their transformations when displaced by the set of discrete lattice translations. In ordered materials where incommensurate spatial periods compete, this general principle is rendered ineffective, often with dramatic consequences. Examples are crystals with broken symmetries from charge or spin density waves, quasiperiodic lattices that produce diffraction patterns with crystallographically forbidden point symmetries, and stacks of two-dimensional lattices with a relative rotation (twist) between layers. In special cases when there is a small difference between the competing periods, a useful work-around is a continuum description where a periodic long-wavelength field produces Bragg scattering that coherently mixes short-wavelength carrier waves. In this work, we advocate an alternative approach to study three-dimensional twisted crystals that replaces their spectrally congested momentum-space Bloch band structures with a representation using squeezed coherent states in a Fock space of free-particle vortex states. This reorganization of the Hilbert space highlights the crucial role of the Coriolis force in the equations of motion that leads to unconventional phase space dynamics and edge state structure generic to a family of complex crystals.",

SL allows resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train ML models with a server, reduce their computational overhead, and enable data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing. Although QML with SL has been studied, the problem remains open in resource-constrained environments where clients lack quantum computing capabilities. Additionally, data privacy leakage between client and server in SL poses risks of reconstruction attacks on the server side. To address these issues, we propose Hybrid Quantum Split Learning (HQSL), an application of Hybrid QML in SL. HQSL enables classical clients to train models with a hybrid quantum server and curtails reconstruction attacks. In addition, we introduce a novel qubit-efficient data-loading technique for designing a quantum layer in HQSL, minimizing both the number of qubits and circuit depth. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate HQSL's feasibility and ability to enhance classification performance compared to its classical models. Notably, HQSL achieves mean improvements of over 3% in both accuracy and F1-score for the Fashion-MNIST dataset, and over 1.5% in both metrics for the Speech Commands dataset. We expand these studies to include up to 100 clients, confirming HQSL's scalability. Moreover, we introduce a noise-based defense mechanism to tackle reconstruction attacks on the server side. Overall, HQSL enables classical clients to collaboratively train their models with a hybrid quantum server, leveraging quantum advantages while improving model performance and security against data privacy leakage-related reconstruction attacks.",

In contrast, we establish a negative correlation between chaos and work when the state is unknown.

Diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetometry has emerged as an ideal tool, offering $\\mu$m-scale resolution, millimeter-scale field of view, high sensitivity, and non-invasive imaging compatible with diverse samples. However, up until now, it has been predominantly used for imaging of static or low-frequency magnetic fields or, concerning MW field imaging, to directly characterize the same microwave device used to drive the NV spin transitions. In this work we leverage an NV center ensemble in diamond for wide-field imaging of MW magnetic fields generated by a test device employing a differential measurement protocol. The microscope is equipped with a MW loop to induce Rabi oscillations between NV spin states, and the MW field from the device-under-test is measured through local deviations in the Rabi frequency.

    "title": "Random ensembles of symplectic and unitary states are indistinguishable",
    "abstract": "A unitary state $t$-design is an ensemble of pure quantum states whose moments match up to the $t$-th order those of states uniformly sampled from a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space. Typically, unitary state $t$-designs are obtained by evolving some reference pure state with unitaries from an ensemble that forms a design over the unitary group $\\mathbb{U}(d)$, as unitary designs induce state designs. However, in this work we study whether Haar random symplectic states -- i.e., states obtained by evolving some reference state with unitaries sampled according to the Haar measure over $\\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$ -- form unitary state $t$-designs. Importantly, we recall that random symplectic unitaries fail to be unitary designs for $t>1$, and that, while it is known that symplectic unitaries are universal, this does not imply that their Haar measure leads to a state design. Notably, our main result states that Haar random symplectic states form unitary $t$-designs for all $t$, meaning that their distribution is unconditionally indistinguishable from that of unitary Haar random states, even with tests that use infinite copies of each state. As such, our work showcases the intriguing possibility of creating state $t$-designs using ensembles of unitaries which do not constitute designs over $\\mathbb{U}(d)$ themselves, such as ensembles that form $t$-designs over $\\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$.",

    "abstract": "The study of information scrambling has profoundly deepened our understanding of many-body quantum systems. Much recent research has been devote to understanding the interplay between scrambling and decoherence in open systems. Continuing in this vein, we investigate scrambling in a noisy encoding-decoding circuit model. Specifically, we consider an $L$-qubit circuit consisting of a Haar-random unitary, followed by noise acting on a subset of qubits, and then by the inverse unitary. Scrambling is measured using the bipartite algebraic out-of-time-order correlator ($\\mathcal{A}$-OTOC), which allows us to track information spread between extensively sized subsystems. We derive an analytic expression for the $\\mathcal{A}$-OTOC that depends on system size and noise strength. In the thermodynamic limit, this system displays a \\textit{butterfly effect} in which infinitesimal noise induces macroscopic information scrambling. We also perform numerical simulations while relaxing the condition of Haar-randomness, which preliminarily suggest that this effect may manifest in a larger set of circuits.",

We argue that in a toy model of quantum measurement the Born rule probabilities can be derived from the unitary Schr\\\"odinger dynamics when certain dynamical parameters are treated as themselves random variables with initial probability distributions. Specifically, we study the perturbed double well model, in which the perturbation is treated as a random variable, and we show that for arbitrary initial distributions within a certain class, the dynamics yields the Born rule probabilities in the joint limits given by long times and small values of Planck's constant (the classical limit). Our results establish the Born rule as a type of universal limiting behavior that is independent of the precise initial dynamical parameters.",

    "abstract": "The manifestation of entanglement within geometric phase is elucidated for spatially-structured photons. It is shown that entanglement parameters manifest in two distinct ways: through statistical superpositions of separable states; and via quantum correlation. It is the latter that is truer to the core idea of entanglement, but the two influences are inherently intertwined within geometric phase. This motivates the construction of a projective, gauge-invariant measure that allows the manifestation of quantum correlation to be pinpointed and explained. An optical circuit consisting of a pair of misoriented optical mode converters gives a practical demonstration of its utility. Its implementation as an analytical simulation is facilitated by a novel pump engineering method which produces photon pairs with tunable entanglement.",

Once a Hamiltonian, $H^{W}(q,\\,p)$, is constrained by the $\\partial ^2 H^{W} / \\partial q \\partial p = 0$ condition, flow properties for generic $1$-dim systems can be analytically obtained in terms of Wigner functions and Wigner currents. For gaussian statistical ensembles, the exact phase-space profile of the quantum fluctuations over the classical trajectories are found, so to interpret them as a suitable Hilbert space state configuration for confronting quantum and classical regimes. In particular, a sort of {\\em quantum camouflage} where the stationarity of classical statistical ensembles can be camouflaged by the stationarity of gaussian quantum ensembles is identified. Besides the broadness of the framework worked out in some previous examples, our results provide an encompassing picture of quantum effects on non-linear dynamical systems which can be interpreted as a first step for finding the complete spectrum of non-standard Hamiltonians.",

    "abstract": "Though parameter shift rules have drastically improved gradient estimation methods for several types of quantum circuits, leading to improved performance in downstream tasks, so far they have not been transferable to linear optics with single photons. In this work, we derive an analytical formula for the gradients in these circuits with respect to phaseshifters via a generalized parameter shift rule, where the number of parameter shifts depends linearly on the total number of photons. Experimentally, this enables access to derivatives in photonic systems without the need for finite difference approximations. Building on this, we propose two strategies through which one can reduce the number of shifts in the expression, and hence reduce the overall sample complexity. Numerically, we show that this generalized parameter-shift rule can converge to the minimum of a cost function with fewer parameter update steps than alternative techniques. We anticipate that this method will open up new avenues to solving optimization problems with photonic systems, as well as provide new techniques for the experimental characterization and control of linear optical systems.",

This is true despite the fact that entanglement between pairs of individual field modes is sparse and appears only when the two individual modes are carefully selected. Our results reveal that, while entanglement between individual modes is limited, bipartite multimode entanglement in quantum field theory is ubiquitous. We further argue that such multimode entanglement is operationally extractable, and it forms the basis of the entanglement commonly discussed in entanglement harvesting protocols.",

We present a compilation algorithm based on Matrix Product Operators for generating compressed circuits enabling real-time simulation on digital quantum computers, that for a given depth are more accurate than all Trotterizations of the same depth. By the efficient use of environment tensors, the algorithm is scalable in depth beyond prior work, and we present circuit compilations of up to 64 layers of $SU(4)$ gates. Surpassing only 1D circuits, our approach can flexibly target a particular quasi-2D gate topology. We demonstrate this by compiling a 52-qubit 2D Transverse-Field Ising propagator onto the IBM Heavy-Hex topology. For all circuit depths and widths tested, we produce circuits with smaller errors than all equivalent depth Trotter unitaries, corresponding to reductions in error by up to 4 orders of magnitude and circuit depth compressions with a factor of over 6.",

However, it becomes increasingly evident that a more comprehensive understanding of quantum state geometry is necessary to explain properties involving Bloch states of multiple bands, such as optical transitions. To this end, we employ quantum state projectors to develop an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism and demonstrate its power with applications to non-linear optics and the theory of electronic polarization. We provide a simple expression for the shift current that resolves its precise relation to the moments of electronic polarization, clarifies the treatment of band degeneracies, and reveals its decomposition into the sum of the skewness of the occupied states and intrinsic multi-state geometry. The projector approach is applied to calculate non-linear optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) layers, using minimal tight-binding models previously calculated by ab initio methods. We close with comments on potential further applications of the projector operator approach to multi-state geometry.",
