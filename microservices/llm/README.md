Chunk 1: Major Concept 1
Layer 1: What, Why, How
Layer 2: What, Why, How (deeper)
Layer 3: What, Why, How (even deeper)

Example Walkthrough:
Input Concept: "Machine Learning"

The system starts by calling explain_concept("Machine Learning", 3).
Chunking the Concept:

The concept "Machine Learning" is chunked into sub-topics like "Algorithms", "Data Preparation", and "Model Evaluation" using chunk_concept().
Generating Explanations:

For each chunk, generate_layered_explanation() will be called.
If complexity level = 3, it will generate three layers of explanation (basic, intermediate, advanced) for each chunk.
Output:

The system would output progressively deeper explanations for each chunk of the concept, based on the "What, Why, How" structure.

Why This Framework Works for LLMs:
Chunking: LLMs can break down complex ideas into logical sub-components, making it easier for the model to focus on each part of the explanation.
Layering: By defining complexity levels, the LLM adjusts its responses to provide explanations that suit both beginners and advanced users.
What, Why, How: This clear structure ensures that each chunk is explained thoroughly, covering the essential aspects of the concept.
